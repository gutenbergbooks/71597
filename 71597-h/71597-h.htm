<p class='c006'><i>Once upon a time two children read aloud together
more or less of Darwin, Spencer, Lyell, Goethe, Carlyle,
Taine, and other writers of equal note. Though
the books were somewhat above their comprehension, and
certainly not so well suited to their years as fairy-tales
and romances, both the choice and the rejection were
deliberately made and consistently maintained. The
discrimination originated neither in excessive fondness
of fact, nor in the slightest dislike of fiction; being solely
due to a greater preference for the stories they themselves
created than for those they found in books.
Presently, one of these two, having found a new playfellow,
stopped inventing and acting and living their
joint imaginings, and the other one had to go on playing
by himself. But he has never forgotten the original
impulse, and so, in collecting the offspring of some of
his earliest and some of his latest play-hours, his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>thoughts recur to the years of the old partnership, and
he cannot please himself better than by putting his
playmate, where she truly belongs, at the beginning of
his “imaginary” playthings.</i></p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>“She’s a darling!” exclaimed the
bay mare, between munches of the
big red apple.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s just what she is!” responded
the off carriage-horse; and then, as part
of his apple fell to the floor, he added
fretfully: “I do wish, Lassie, that you
girls wouldn’t talk to a fellow when he’s
doing something! You’ve made me lose
half my apple!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Old Reveille, with the prudence of
twenty-eight years of experience, carefully
deposited the unmasticated fraction
of his apple beside an uneaten one in
his manger before remarking reflectively:
“She’s a thoroughbred; but she’s not the
beauty her mother was at the same age.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>“Fie!” reproved one of the cobs:
“how can you be so ungallant, when she
always gives you an extra apple or piece
of sugar?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I call it shameful unfairness,” growled
the nigh horse of the pair. “She doesn’t
keep you up till two or three in the morning
at balls and cotillions. She doesn’t
so much as ride you in the park, as
she does Lassie or Bubbles. When you
haven’t done a step of work in six years,
and spend your summers out in the pasture
and your winters in a box-stall eating
your head off, why should you get a
double portion?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes,” whinnied Bubbles, plaintively;
“and, what’s more, she always kisses
you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Reveille, who meantime had swallowed
his first apple, looked up with a lofty
smile of superiority. Then he slowly
winked his off eye, remarked, “Naturally,
you don’t understand it,” and fell to lipping
his second apple caressingly, previous
to the decisive crunch. “See if that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>doesn’t drive the women wild,” he cogitated,
with a grin.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now isn’t that just like a man!” complained
Lassie. “As if it wasn’t enough
to get more than his share, but he must
go and have a secret along with it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Huh!” grunted the polo pony, who
was, of necessity, the brains-carrier of the
stable; “if it’s family property, it can’t
be much of a secret; for I never heard
of anything to which six humans were
privy that didn’t at once become town
gossip. And they must be aware of it,
for, from the Major to the Minor, they discriminate
in favor of Reveille in a manner
most reprehensible.” The polo pony was
famous for the choiceness of his language
and the neatness of his wit; but he was
slightly vain, as was shown by his adding:
“Pretty good, that, eh? Major—that’s
the man we take out riding or driving.
Minor—that’s the three-year-old. Do
you hitch up to that post?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do they all know your secret, Reveille?”
asked Lassie, ingratiatingly.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>“They think they do,” replied the
veteran. “They don’t, though,” he added;
and then, heaving a sigh, he continued:
“But the roan filly did, and Mr. Lewis’s
big grey, and dear old Sagitta—that was
the Russian wolf-hound, who died before
any of you youngsters joined our set.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then I fail to perceive,” remarked the
polo pony, “why they should treat you
differently, if they are ignorant of the circumstances
to which you refer.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“My dear colt,” retorted Reveille, “when
you are grown to horsehood you will learn
that we are all governed by our imaginations,
and not by our knowledge. Why
do you shy at a scrap of white paper?
Superficially because you are nearly related
to an ass, actually because your
fancy makes it into a white elephant.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And how about your putting your
head and tail up, and careering all over
the home lot, last summer, just because
our Major fired his revolver at a hawk?
Were you an ass, too?” saucily questioned
one of the cobs.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>“Probably,” assented the oldster, genially;
“for that very incident proves my
point. What that shot reminded me of
was the last time I heard my Major fire
his revolver. I saw a long, gentle slope,
up which a brigade of ‘secesh’ were
charging to a railroad embankment protected
by a battery of twelve-pounders firing
six rounds of case-shot to the minute.
And I was right among the guns again,
seeing and hearing it all; and my Major—only
he was a captain then—was
saying as coolly and quietly as he orders
the carriage now: ‘Steady, men, steady!
There’s a hundred yards yet, and they
can’t stand it to the finish. Double
charge with canister! Three more rounds
will settle them.’ Which was just what it
did. We horses, with the aid of the men
and guns, held the Weldon railroad,
and Lee and his mules stopped holding
Richmond.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Doesn’t he tell a story beautifully?”
remarked Bubbles, in a distinctly audible
aside to Lassie.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>“I’ve never known a better raconteur,”
answered Lassie, in a stage whisper of
equal volume.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Lay you a peck of oats to a quart that
the girls get that secret out of him,” whispered
the Majors saddle-horse, who, as a
Kentuckian of thoroughbred stock, had
sporting and race-track proclivities.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not with me!” denied the second cob.
“Besides, no gentleman ever bets on a
certainty. Gaze at the self-satisfied look
on the old fool’s phiz. Lord! how a
pretty face and figure, combined with flattery,
can come it round the old ones!”</p>

<p class='c006'>There could be no doubt about it. Reveille
was smirking, though trying not to
desperately; and to aid his attempt, he
went on, with a pretence of unconscious
musing, as if he were still in the past:
“Yes; we are ruled by our imaginations,
and, consequently, though I have reached
the honourable but usually neglected period
in life which retires an officer and a horse
from active service, I get a box-stall and
extra rations and perquisites.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>“How rarely is the story-telling faculty
united with the philosophical mind!” soliloquised
Bubbles to the rafters.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And how rarely,” rejoined Lassie, “are
those two qualities combined with a finished,
yet graphic, style!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I would gladly tell you that story,”
said the old war-horse, “but it isn’t one
to be repeated. Every horse who isn’t a
cow—to make an Irish bull, which, by
the bye, is a very donkeyish form of joke—has
done certain things that he has keenly
regretted, even though he believes that he
acted for the good—just as brave soldiers
will act as spies, honourable lawyers defend
a scoundrel, and good women give ‘at
homes.’”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What a decadence there has been in
true wit!” remarked Lassie, apropos of
nothing. “It is such a pleasure to be put
next a horse at dinner whose idea of
humour was formed before youthful pertness
was allowed to masquerade as wit.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is a mortification to me to this day,”
went on Reveille, “even though the outcome
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>has justified me. You know what
our equine code of honour is—how we
won’t lie or trick or steal or kill, as the
humans do. Well, for nearly two months
I was as false and tricky as a man.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t believe it,” dissented Bubbles.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The truly great always depreciate
themselves,” asserted one of the mares.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, ladies, I speak the truth,” reiterated
the warrior; “even now the memory
galls me worse than a spur.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It would ease your conscience, I am
sure,” suggested Bubbles, “to confess the
wrong, if wrong there was. A highly sensitive
and chivalric nature so often takes a
morbidly extreme view of what is at most
but a peccadillo.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“This, alas! was no peccadillo,” sighed
Reveille, “as you will acknowledge after
hearing it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I may be a colt, but I’m not a dolt,”
sneered the polo pony to himself. “As if
we weren’t all aware that the garrulous
old fool has been itching to inflict his long
tail upon us for the last ten minutes.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>“My one consolation,” continued Reveille,
“is that the roan filly was in the
traces with me and an equal culprit in—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I thought that one of the sex of Adam
would saddle it on a woman before he got
through,” interjected the cob.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i><span lang="fr">Cherchez la femme!</span></i>” laughed the polo
pony, delighted to trot out his French.</p>

<p class='c006'>“All I meant to suggest, ladies and
gentlemen,” affirmed Reveille, reflectively,
“is that a woman is an excuse for anything.
If this world is a fine world, it is
because she pulls the reins more often for
good than for bad.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Those who always praise woman
know her but little; those who always
blame her know her not at all,’” quoted
the worldly-wise Kentuckian.</p>

<p class='c006'>Reveille swallowed the last fragment of
his second apple, cleared his throat, and
began:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“It was after Five Forks, where my
Captain got a major’s oak-leaf added to
his shoulder-straps, and a Minié ball in
his arm, that the thing began. When he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>came out of the hospital—long before he
should have, for the bone had been shattered,
and took its own time to knit—we
hung about Washington, swearing at our
bad luck, my Major suffering worse than
a docked horse in fly-time from the little
splinters of bone that kept working out,
and I eating my head off in—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“History does repeat itself,” murmured
the envious carriage-horse.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, one day, after nearly three
months of idleness, when I was about
dead with stalldom, I permitted the orderly
to saddle me, and after a little dispute
with him as to my preferences, I let him
take me round to Scott Square. There
for the first time I met the roan filly and
the big grey. She was a dear!” he added,
with a sigh, and paused a moment.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah, don’t stop there!” begged one of
the ladies.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Get a gait on you,” exhorted the cob.</p>

<p class='c006'>Reveille sighed again softly, shook his
head, and then came back to the present.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘May you never lack for oats and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>grass,’ said I, greeting them in my most
affable style.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘May you die in clover,’ responded the
grey, nodding politely.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘May you have all the sugar you desire,’
added the filly, sweetly, and greeting
me with a graceful toss of the head. That
told me that a woman belonged to her, for
men never give sugar. Sometimes, on a
forced march, my Major used to divide his
ration of hardtack with me; but I never
tasted sugar until—well, we mustn’t get
ahead too fast.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No danger, while he is doing the lipping,”
grumbled the disagreeable cob.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘I see by your saddle that you are in
the service,’ remarked the big grey. ‘I
am not so fortunate. Between ourselves,
I think the fellow I let ride me would do
anything sooner than fight—though, now
it’s all over, he says if he’d returned from
Europe in time he should have gone into
the army.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“I shook my head dejectedly. ‘I’m very
much off my feed,’ I told them. ‘My Major
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>is not able to ride, and won’t be for a long
time, so I’m horribly afraid I’ve been sold.
I really wouldn’t have believed it of him!’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘What things man is capable of
doing!’ sighed the filly, with tears of sympathy
in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Cheer up, comrade,’ cried the grey,
consolingly. ‘Even if you are sold, you
might be worse off. You are still a saddle-horse,
and as Miss Gaiety and I both have
good stables, you probably will have the
same luck, since you are in our set. The
fellow I carry spurred my predecessor,
when he was leg weary, at an impossible
jump in Leicestershire, and because he
fell short and spoiled his knees the brute
ordered him sold, and he was put to dragging
a huckster’s cart, besides being half
starved. You’re not so bad off as that yet.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“Just then three people came out of the
house before which we were standing, and
I can’t tell you how my heart jumped with
joy, and how my ears went forward, when
I saw that one of them was my Major.
For the instant I was so happy that I felt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>like kicking up; but the next moment I
was ready to die with mortification at the
thought of how I had cheapened him
to strangers. Think of my saying such
things to them of the best man that ever
lived!</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘That’s <i>my Major</i>,’ I told them, arching
my neck and flicking my tail with
pride. ‘He held the Weldon railroad
without—’”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But you told us a little while ago,”
protested Lassie, “that—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, yes,” hastily broke in the story-teller
with a note of deprecation in his
voice. “Don’t you see, girls, that having
just belittled him, I had to give him the
credit of it, though really we horses—But
there, I won’t go into that now.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That much is saved!” muttered the cob.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Walpole,” said the polo pony, “well
described a certain period of life when he
denied that a man was in his dotage, but
suggested that he was in his ‘anecdotage.’”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It was far from my intention—”
Reveille began, with dignity.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>“I do wish you would bridle your
tongues, the two of you,” snapped Bubbles.
“It’s just what I should expect of a colt
that has never seen anything better than a
poplar ball and a wooden mallet, and so
dislikes to hear of real battles. Please pay
no heed to him, Mr. Reveille.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“We don’t notice either of them one curb
or snaffle bit,” declared Lassie, “so why
should you? Forgive me for interrupting
you, and do tell us what you told the
steeds about our Major?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Reveille hesitated, and then resumed
his tale: “‘His battery held the Weldon
railroad without any infantry supports,’
I told them, adding, ‘Sheridan’s right-hand
man. Perfect devil at fighting, and the
kindest human in the world.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“The roan filly, being a woman, answered:
‘He looks both;’ but the grey,
being something more stupid, remarked:
‘Then what made you think he had sold
you?’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Dear Mr. Solitaire,’ cried the mare,
‘you must know that we all say things in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>society, not because we think them, but to
make conversation. I knew Mr.—thank
you, Mr. Reveille—was joking the moment
he spoke.’ I tell you, gentlemen,
women can put the blinders on facts when
they really try!</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘What do you think of my Felicia?’
asked Miss Gaiety.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I had been so taken up with my dear
that I hadn’t so much as looked at hers.
But, oh, fellows, she was a beauty! Filly
built, right through—just made to be
shown off by a habit; hair as smooth as a
mare’s coat, and as long and thick as an
undocked tail; eyes—oh, well, halter it!
there is no use trying to describe her eyes,
or her nose, or her mouth, or her smile.
She was just the dearest, loveliest darling
that I ever did see!</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mr. Lewis was putting her up, while
my poor dear stood watching them, with a
look in his face I had never seen. Now,
when there was anything to be done, my
Major was always the man who did it, and
it puzzled me why he had let Mr. Lewis get
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>the better of him. The next instant I saw
that his right arm was still in a sling, and
that his sword-sash was used to tie it to
his body. Then I knew why he had an
up-and-down line in his forehead, and why
he bit his mustache.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Can I give you any help, Major
Moran?’ asked Mr. Lewis, when he had
helped Miss Fairley mount.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Thanks, no,’ answered my pal, rather
curtly, I thought; and putting his left
hand on me, into the saddle he vaulted.
But he was foolish to do it, as he said
‘Ouch!’ below his breath; and he must
have turned pale, for Miss Fairley cried out,
‘Mr. Lewis, quick! He’s going to faint!’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Nothing of the kind,’ denied my
backer, giving a good imitation laugh,
even while his hand gripped my neck and
I felt him swerve in the saddle. ‘Miss
Fairley, I will not let even you keep me
an interesting invalid. If there was any
fighting left, I should long since have
been ordered to the front by the surgeons;
but now they wink their eyes at shirking.’</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>“‘I told you you ought not to go, and
now I’m sure of it,’ urged Miss Fairley.
‘You’ll never be able to control such a
superb and spirited horse with only your
left arm.’”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Bet that’s a subsequent piece of embroidery,”
whispered the polo pony to his
nearest neighbor.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now, I have to confess that I had
come out of the stable feeling full of
friskiness, and I hadn’t by any means
worked it off on the orderly, much of a
dance as I’d given him. But the way
I put a check-strap on my spirits and
dropped my tail and ears and head was
a circumstance, I tell you.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘There’s not the slightest cause for
alarm,’ my confrère answered her. ‘The
old scamp has an inclination to lose his
head in battle, but he’s steady enough as
a roadster.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘I really wish, though, that you
wouldn’t insist on coming,’ persisted Miss
Fairley, anxiously. ‘You know—’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Of course, Miss Fairley,’ interrupted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>my Major, with a nasty little laugh, ‘if
you prefer to have your ride a solitude <i><span lang="fr">à
deux</span></i>, and I am in—’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Shall we start?’ interrupted Miss
Fairley, her cheeks very red, and her eyes
blazing. She didn’t wait for an answer,
but touched up the filly into a trot, and
for the first mile or two not a word would
she say to my colleague; and even when
he finally got her to answer him, she
showed that she wasn’t going to forget
that speech.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, what began like this went from
bad to worse. He wasn’t even aware that
he had been shockingly rude, and never
so much as apologised for his speech.
When Miss Fairley didn’t ask him to ride
with them the next day, he ordered me
saddled, and joined them on the road;
and this he did again and again, though
she was dreadfully cool to him. My dear
seemed unable to behave. He couldn’t
be himself. He was rude to Mr. Lewis,
sulky to Miss Fairley, and kept a dreadful
rein on me. That week was the only time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>in my life when he rode me steadily on the
curb. My grief! how my jaw did ache!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I wish it would now,” interrupted the
cob, sulkily. Let it be said here that
horses are remarkably sweet-natured but
this particular one was developing a
splint, and was inevitably cross.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Don’t be a nag,” requested one of the
mares.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The roan filly always blamed my
Major for making such a mess of the
whole thing; but even though I recognised
how foolish he was to kick over
the traces, I saw there were reasons
enough to excuse him. In the first place,
he enlisted when he was only nineteen,
and having served straight through, he
had had almost no experience of women.
Then for six months he had been suffering
terribly with his arm, with the result
that what was left of his nerves were
all on edge. He began to ride before
he ought, and though I did my best to be
easy, I suppose that every moment in the
saddle must have caused him intense pain.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>Finally, he had entered himself for the
running only after Mr. Lewis had turned
the first mile-post and had secured the inside
track. I really think, if ever a man was
justified in fretting on the bit my chum was.</p>

<p class='c006'>“At the end of the week Miss Gaiety
bade me good-bye. ‘I heard Mr. Fairley
say that we could now go back to Yantic;
that’s where we live, you know,’ she told
me. ‘It’s been a long job getting our
claim for uniforms and blankets allowed,
but the controller signed a warrant yesterday.
I’m really sorry that we are to be
separated. If your associate had behaved
decently, you might have been asked to
visit us.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Yes,’ announced the big grey; ‘Miss
Fairley has asked the bully who rides me
and myself to spend a few days with you
next week. I suppose they’ll settle it then.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“But the officer and horse who commanded
the battery which held the Weldon
railroad weren’t going to be beaten as
easily as that, you may be sure! When
I took my rider back to the stable that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>afternoon, I heard him say to the orderly:
‘Jackson, I’m going north next week, and
shall want Reveille to start before me.
I’m in too much pain to give you your
orders now, but come round to-morrow
morning and get your instructions.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yantic was nothing but a little village
clustered about a great woollen-mill, without
any stable or hotel to live in, so we
had to put up at Norwich, a place seven
miles away; and it was a case of put up,
I tell you, in both food and attendance!
For a decently brought up horse to come
down to a hotel livery-stable is a trial I
never want to go through again. In the
field I never minded what came, but I do
hate musty corn and damp bedding.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You girls would have laughed to see
the roan filly’s face the first time we met
on the road.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Horse alive!’ she cried, without so
much as a greeting, ‘you don’t mean to say
you have hopes? Why, Mr. Solitaire and
that horrid Mr. Lewis arrive to-day, and
the thing’s probably as good as decided.’</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>“‘My Major is very resolute,’ said I.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘So is a mule,’ snapped Miss Gaiety,
‘but we don’t think the more of him for
that.’”</p>

<p class='c006'>The polo pony gave a horse laugh as
he said, “<i>That</i> was one on you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It was,” acknowledged Reveille; “and
I regret to say it made me lose my temper
to such an extent that I retorted, ‘I
can’t say much for the taste of <i>your</i>
woman!’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘No,’ assented the filly; ‘if what you
and Mr. Solitaire say is true, she’s taking
the worse of the two. But then, a human
can’t help it. If you covered a horse all
over with clothes, do you think any one
would know much about him? Moreover,
two-thirds of what men do or say is said
or done only to fool a woman. How can
a girl help making mistakes, when she’s
got nothing to go by but talk? Why, look
at it. Your Major seems balky most of
the time, won’t talk half of it, and when
he does, says the things he shouldn’t;
while Mr. Lewis is always affable, talks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>well, and pays indirect compliments better
than any man I ever met.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘If she could only be told!’ I groaned.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘She would be, if I could talk,’ sighed
the mare. ‘I’d let her know how he treats
his horses!’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Miss Gaiety,’ I ejaculated, ‘I’ve got
an idea.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘What?’ she demanded.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Wait a bit till I’ve had time to think
it out,’ said I. ‘Gettysburg wasn’t fought
in five minutes.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Gettysburg was a big thing,’ she answered.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘So’s my idea,’ I told her.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the meantime my Major was explaining
to Miss Fairley that the government
had sent him to New London to
inspect the ordnance at Forts Trumbull
and Griswold, and that he found it pleasanter
to stay in Norwich, and run down
by train to New London for his work.
That’s the way humans lie when it doesn’t
deceive any one and it isn’t expected that
it will. Of course Miss Fairley knew what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>brought him North, and why he preferred
Norwich to New London! One thing he
did do, though, which was pretty good.
He apologised to her for having said what
he did before their first ride, told her that
his wound had been troubling him so that
at times he scarcely knew what he was
saying, and declared he’d been sorry ever
since. He was humble! The Eleventh
Battery of Light Artillery would never
have known him.</p>

<p class='c006'>‘There,’ sniffed Miss Gaiety; ‘if the
idiot had only talked in that vein ten days
ago, he might have done something. Oh,
you men, you men!’</p>

<p class='c006'>“At least he won a small favour; for
when he asked leave, at parting, to be her
companion the next day in a ride, she told
him he might join her and Mr. Lewis, if he
wished. But the permission wasn’t given
with the best of grace, and she didn’t ask
him to luncheon before the start.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I thought out my idea over night, and
put it in shape to tell. My Major took me
to the Fairleys’ a little early, and so went
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>in, leaving me alone. In a minute, however,
a groom brought the filly and the
grey round to the door, and with them
came Sagitta, the Russian wolf-hound,
whom, it seems, Mr. Lewis had brought
from Europe, and had just presented to
Miss Fairley.</p>

<p class='c006'>“After the barest greetings, I unfolded
my scheme. ‘I don’t know,’ said I, ‘what
Mr. Sagitta thinks, but we three are a
spike-team in agreeing that Mr. Lewis
is a brute.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘I bow-wow to that,’ assented the dog.
‘He kicked me twice, coming up yesterday,
because I was afraid to go up the
steps of the baggage-car.’</p>

<p class='c006'>‘So far as we can see he is going to
win Miss Fairley,’ I continued. ‘As Miss
Gaiety says she’s a dear, I think we ought
to prevent it.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Very pretty,’ says the grey; ‘but, may
I ask, who is to interfere and put the hobbles
on him?’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘We are to tell her he’s cruel.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘She won’t understand us, if we tell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>her till doomsday. These humans are so
stupid!’ growled Sagitta.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘That’s where my idea comes in,’ I
bragged—a little airily, it is to be feared.
‘We can’t, of course, tell it to her in
words, but we can act it.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Eh?’ exclaimed the filly, with a sudden
look of intelligence.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Not possible,’ snorted the big grey.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘I see,’ cried the mare, her woman’s
wits grasping the whole thing in a flash,
and in her delight she kicked up her hind
legs in the most graceful manner.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Heyday!’ exclaimed the grey, using
our favourite expletive.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It didn’t take me long to explain to
him and Sagitta, and they entered into the
scheme eagerly. We were so hot to begin
on it that we pawed the road all into holes
in our impatience.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Presently out came the three, and then
the fun began. Mr. Lewis stepped forward
to mount Felicia, and at once Miss
Gaiety backed away, snorting. Then the
groom left us, and tried to hold her; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>not a bit of it; every time Mr. Lewis tried
to approach she’d get wild.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Finally my Major joined in by walking
over to help, and the mare at once put her
head round and rubbed it against him, and
stood as quiet as a mouse. So he says:
‘I’ve only my left arm, Miss Fairley, but I
think we can manage it;’ and the next
moment she was in the saddle.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Lewis was pretty angry-looking as he
went toward his own horse; and when he,
too, began to back and snort and shiver,
he didn’t look any better, you may be sure
of that. You ought to have seen it!
The brute caught him by the bridle, and
then the grey kept backing away or dodging
from him. Out on the lawn they
went, cutting it up badly, then into Miss
Fairley’s pet bed of roses, then smashing
into the shrubberies. I never saw better
acting. Any one would have sworn the
horse was half dead with fright.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It didn’t take very much of this to
make Lewis lose all self control.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘You cursed mule!’ he raved, his face
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>white with passion; ‘if I had a decent
whip, I’d cut the heart out of you!’ And
suiting the action to the thought he struck
the grey between the eyes with his crop
a succession of violent blows, until, in his
fury, he broke the stick. Then he clenched
his fist and struck Solitaire on the nose,
and would have done so a second time if
Miss Fairley hadn’t spoken.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Stop!’ she called hotly, and Lewis
dropped his fist like a flash. Felicia was
breathing very fast and her cheeks were
white, while her hands trembled almost as
much as Solitaire had. Her face wore a
queer look as she continued: ‘I—excuse
me, Mr. Lewis, but I couldn’t bear to see
you strike him. He—I don’t think he—something
has frightened him. Please
give him just a moment.’ Then she
turned to my dear, saying, ‘Perhaps you
can calm him, Major Moran?’</p>

<p class='c006'>“I should think he could! Talk of
lambs! Well, that was Solitaire when my
Major went up to him. He let himself be
led out of the flower-bed back to the road
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>as quiet as a kitten. The moment Lewis
tried to come near him, however, back
away he would, even from my confrère.
The groom tried to help; but it takes
more than three humans to control a horse
who doesn’t want to be controlled.</p>

<p class='c006'>“After repeated attempts they got tired
of trying; and then Mr. Lewis suggested,
with a laugh that didn’t sound nice:
‘Well, Major, we mustn’t cheat Miss
Fairley of her afternoon; and since you
seem able to manage my beast, perhaps
you’ll ride him, and let me take yours?’</p>

<p class='c006'>“Usually I should have been very much
pained at my comrade’s nodding his head,
but this time it was exactly what I wanted.
Whoop! Ride me? Neigh, neigh! If
you ever saw a coward in an ague of a blue
funk, that is what I was. I blessed my
stars none of the Eleventh Battery were
round! Lewis tried; but, do his best, I
wouldn’t let him back me. When my
Major interfered, I sidled up to my dear
just as if I couldn’t keep away from him;
but when he attempted to hold me for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>Lewis to mount, I went round in a circle,
always keeping him between me and the
brute. It was oats to me, you’d better
believe, to see the puzzled, worried look
on Miss Fairley’s face as she watched the
whole thing.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, they discussed what they called
‘the mystery,’ and finally agreed that they
couldn’t ride that afternoon, so we horses
were sent down to the stable, and the three
went back to the verandah. Sagitta told
me afterward what happened there.</p>

<p class='c006'>‘Come here, pup,’ calls Lewis to him,
the moment they were seated.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sagitta backed away two steps, bristling
up, and growling a bit.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Come here, you brute!’ ordered Lewis
hotly, rising.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sagitta crouched a little, drew his lips
away from his fangs, and pitched his growl
‘way down in his throat.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Look out! That dog means mischief,’
cried my Major.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Are the animals possessed?’ roared
Lewis, his voice as angry as Sagitta’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>snarl, yet stepping backwards, for it looked
as if the dog were about to spring.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But my Major didn’t retreat—not he!
He sprang between the wolf-hound and
Miss Fairley. ‘Down, sir!’ he ordered
sharply; and Sagitta dropped his lips and
his bristles, and came right up to him, wagging
his tail, and trying to lick his hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Isn’t it extraordinary?’ cried Miss
Fairley, with a crease in her forehead.
‘Here, Sagitta!’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Miss Fairley, be careful!’ pleaded my
Major; but there wasn’t the slightest necessity.
Sagitta was by her side like a flash,
and was telling her how he loved her, in
every way that dog could. And there he
stayed till Lewis came forward, when he
backed away again, snarling.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now, in all their Washington intercourse
my Major had been the surly one;
but in the interval he had evidently had
time to realise his mistake, and to see that
he must correct it. Probably, too, he
wasn’t depressed by what had just taken
place. Anyway, that afternoon he was as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>pleasant and jolly as he knew how to be.
But Mr. Lewis! Well, I acknowledge
he’d had enough to make any man mad,
and that was what he was. Cross, sulky,
blurting out disagreeable things in a disagreeable
voice, with a disagreeable face:
he did make an exhibition of himself, so
Sagitta said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“After as long a stay as was proper, my
Major told them he must go, and I was
brought round. Miss Fairley came to the
stoop with him, and didn’t I prick up my
ears when I heard her say:</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Since you were defrauded of your
ride to-day, Major Moran, perhaps you will
lunch here to-morrow, and afterward we
will see if we can’t be more successful?’</p>

<p class='c006'>“The next day our interference was done
a little differently. When we were brought
round to the door, there was Mr. Lewis
with a pair of cruelly big rowelled spurs on
his boots, a brutal Mexican quirt in his
hand, and a look on his face to match the
two. Of course the grey gave him a lot
of trouble in mounting, but we had already
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>planned a different policy; and so, after
enough snorting and trembling to make
Felicia look thoughtful, he finally was
allowed to get on Mr. Solitaire’s back.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Much good it did him! The filly and
I paired off just as if we were having a
bridle trip in double harness; but do his
best, Mr. Lewis could not keep the grey
abreast of us. Twenty feet in front, or
thirty feet behind, that was where he was
during the whole ride, and Lewis fought
one long battle trying to make it otherwise.
He had had the reins buckled to the lower
bar of the curb, so it must have been
pretty bad for the grey, but there was no
flinching about him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Every now and then I could hear the
blows of the quirt behind me; and when,
occasionally, the grey passed us, I could
see his sides gored and bleeding where
they had been torn by the spurs, and
bloody foam was all round his jaw, and
flecked his chest and flanks. But he knew
what he meant to do, and he did it without
any heed to his own suffering. There was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>joy when the filly told us that every time
the swish of the quirt was heard she could
feel her rider shiver a little; and Felicia
must have been distressed at the look of
the horse, for she cut the ride short by
suggesting a return home.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sagitta informed us afterward that if
Mr. Lewis had been bad the day before,
he was the devil that afternoon on the verandah,
and Miss Fairley treated him like
one. What is more, she vetoed a ride for
the next day by saying that she thought
it was getting too cold to be pleasant.
When we had ridden away, Solitaire later
told me, she excused herself to Mr. Lewis,
and went to the stable and fed the grey with
sugar, patting him, and telling the groom
to put something on the spur-gashes.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We horses didn’t hear anything more
for three days, at the end of which time
my pal and I rode over one morning, and
reminded Miss Fairley that she had promised
to show us where we should find some
fringed gentians; and though it was the
coldest day of the autumn, Felicia didn’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>object, but ordered Miss Gaiety saddled,
and away we went.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We really had a very good time getting
those gentians! Nothing was ever done
with the flowers, however, owing to circumstances
which constitute the most
painful part of my confession. For a
horse and an officer, I had been pretty
tricky already, but that was nothing to
the fraud I tried to perpetrate that morning.
After our riders had mounted for
the return to Yantic, I suggested to Miss
Gaiety what I thought would be a winning
race for my Major, which was neither more
nor less than that she should run away, and
let him save Miss Fairley. The roan
came right into the scheme, and we arranged
just how it was to be managed.
She was to bolt, and I was to catch her;
but since my Major had only his left arm,
as soon as she felt his hand on the rein
she was to quiet down; and I have no
doubt but it would have been a preeminently
successful coup if it had been
run to the finish.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>“What actually happened was that the
mare bolted at a rabbit which very opportunely
came across the road, and away she
went like a shell from a mortar. I didn’t
even wait for orders, but sprang after her at
a pace that would have settled it before
many minutes. Just as I had got my
gait, however, my poor dear gave a groan,
reeled in his saddle, and before I could
check myself he pitched from my back to
the ground. I could not stop my momentum
under thirty feet, but I was back at
his side in a moment, sniffing at him, and
turning him over with my nose, for his
wounded arm was twisted under him, and
his face was as white as paper. That was
the worst moment of my life, for I thought
I’d killed him. I put my head up in the
air, and didn’t I whinny and neigh!</p>

<p class='c006'>“The filly, finding that something wrong
had happened, concluded to postpone the
runaway, and came back to where I was
standing. Miss Fairley was off her like a
flash, and, kneeling beside my treasure, tried
to do what she could for him, though that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>really wasn’t anything. Just then, by
good luck, along came a farmer in an oxcart.
They lifted my poor dear into it,
and a pretty gloomy procession took up
its walk for Yantic.</p>

<p class='c006'>“When we arrived at the Fairleys’ house,
there was a to-do, as you may imagine.
He was carried upstairs, while I went for
the doctor, taking a groom with me, because
humans are so stupid that they only
understand each other. I taught that
groom a thing or two about what a horse
can do in the way of speed that I don’t
believe he has ever forgotten.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Did you do better than 1.35½?” inquired
the Kentuckian; but Reveille paid
no heed to the question.</p>

<p class='c006'>“After that sprint I had about the
dullest month of my life, standing doing
nothing in the Fairleys’ stable, while nearly
dying of anxiety and regret. The only
thing of the slightest interest in all that
time occurred the day after our attempted
runaway, when Mr. Lewis came down to
the stable, and gave orders about having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>the big grey sent after him. He wasn’t a
bit in a sweet temper—that I could see;
and though I overheard one of the grooms
say that he was to come back later, as soon
as the nurse and doctors were out of the
house, the big grey thought otherwise, and
predicted that we should never see each
other again. Our parting was truly touching,
and put tears in the filly’s eyes.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Friends,’ said Solitaire, ‘I don’t think
he will ever forgive me, and I suppose I
am in for a lot of brutality from him; but
I am not sorry. If you ever give me
another thought please say to yourself:
“He did his best to save a woman from
having her life made one long night-mare
by a cruel master.”’</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nothing much happened in the weeks
my Major was housed, with the exception
of one development that had for me an
extremely informing and delightful quality.
One day, about a month after our cropper,
Felicia came down to the stable, and without
so much as a look or a word for Miss
Gaiety, came straight into my stall, flung
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>her arms about my neck, and laid her soft
cheek caressingly against it, for some moments.
Then she kissed me on the nose
very tenderly, and offered me what I
thought were some little white stones. I
had never tasted sugar before, and nothing
but her repeated tempting and urging persuaded
me to keep the lumps in my mouth
long enough to get the taste on my tongue.
(I have to confess that since then I have
developed a strong liking for all forms of
sweetmeats.) What is more, she came
down every day after that, and sometimes
twice a day, to caress and feed me. There
was no doubt about it, that for some reason
she had become extraordinarily fond of
me!</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is awfully hard in this world to
know what will turn out the best thing.
As a matter of fact, the tumble off my
back was about the luckiest accident that
ever befell my Major; for it broke open
the old wound, and as the local doctors
did not have six hundred other injured men
under them, they could give it proper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>attention, which the hospital surgeons had
never been able to do. One of them
extracted all the pieces of bone, set the
arm, and then put it in a plaster jacket,
which ought to have healed it in good
shape very quickly. But for some reason
it didn’t. In fact, I became very much
alarmed over the length of my Major’s
convalescence, till one day I overheard one
of the stablemen say:</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Lor’! He won’t get well no too fast,
with Miss Felicia to fluff his pillers, an’
run his erran’s, an’ play to him, an’ read
aloud to him, an’ him got nothin’ to do
but just lay back easy an’ look at her.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then I realised that it would be some
time before he would feel strong enough to
go back to his ordnance inspecting.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Finally, one afternoon, the filly and I
were saddled and brought round to the
front door, and there were Miss Fairley
and my Major, both looking as well and
happy as their best friend would want to
see them. It was a nice day, and away we
went over the New England hills.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>“There wasn’t much surliness or coolness
on that ride, and what they didn’t
talk about is hardly worth mentioning.
After they had fairly cantered, conversationally,
for over three hours, however, they
slowed down, and finally only Felicia tried
to talk, and she did it so jerkily and confusedly,
with such a deal of stumbling and
stammering, that presently, try her best,
she had to come to a halt, too. Then there
was a most awkward silence, until suddenly
my Major burst out, more as if the
sentence were shot from a gun than as if
he were speaking it:</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Oh, Felicia, if you could only—’</p>

<p class='c006'>“That seemed to me too indefinite a
wish to answer easily, and apparently Miss
Fairley thought the same, for another silence
ensued which was embarrassing even
to me. So far as I could make out, my
Major could not speak, and Miss Fairley
would not. I was as anxious as he was to
know what she would say, and in my suspense
I suddenly conceived an idea that
was little short of inspiration, though I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>say it who ought not. I asked the roan
filly:</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Is your Felicia resting her weight on
the side toward my Major, or on the side
away from him?’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘She has a very bad seat in her
saddle,’ the mare told me, ‘and she is
resting all her weight on the side next
you.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Then, Miss Gaiety,’ I suggested, ‘I
think they will like it if we snuggle.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Well, just for this once I will,’ replied
the filly, shyly.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Reveille turned in his stall, and, walking
over to his manger, picked up a wisp of
hay. But the action was greeted by an outburst
from the ladies.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, you are not going to stop there,
dear Mr. Reveille!” they chorused.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I always did hate a quitter on the home
stretch,” chimed in the discontented cob,
pleased to have a grievance.</p>

<p class='c006'>The narrator shook his head.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No gentleman,” he asserted, “who overheard
what followed would ever tell of it;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>and a horse has an even higher standard
of honour.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah, darling Mr. Reveille,” pleaded
the feminine part of his audience, “just a
little more!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I hate to seem mulish,” responded the
horse, “and so I will add one small incident
that is too good not to be repeated. When
we rode up to the house that evening,
shamefully late for dinner, my Major lifted
Miss Fairley off Miss Gaiety in a way that
suggested that she might be very breakable,
and, after something I don’t choose
to tell you about, he said:</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘I wonder if we shall ever have another
such ride!’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘It doesn’t seem possible, Stanley,’
whispered my Felicia, very softly. ‘You
know, even the horses seemed to understand!’”</p>

<p class='c006'>Just as Reveille finished thus, a human
voice was heard, saying:</p>

<p class='c006'>“You will have the veterinary see the
cob at once, and let me know if it is a case
which requires more than blistering.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>Then came a second and very treble
voice. “Papa,” it begged, “will oo lif’ me
up on ol’ Weveille’s back?” And the next
moment a child of three was sitting astride
the old warrior and clinging to his mane.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, you old scoundrel,” said the
human, “do you know you are getting
outrageously fat?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Weveille isn’t not any scoundwel,”
denied the child, earnestly. “Mama says
Weveille is a’ ol’ darlin’.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Your mama, fortunately for Reveille
and me, always had a soft spot for idiots,”
explained the man, stroking the horse’s
nose affectionately. “But I will say this
for the old fellow: if most folly resulted
as well as his, there would be a big premium
on fools.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Reveille winked his off eye at the other
steeds.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Aren’t these humans comical?” he
laughed.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>Before some blazing logs, which fill
a deep fireplace with warmth that
overflows to just the right extent into the
room, stands, slightly skewed, a sofa. The
sofa is a comfortable one. It is short, deep,
and low; and the arms have a suggestion
of longing to be filled that is truly seductive.
In addition, two down cushions imply that
the sofa is quite prepared to fit itself to
any figure, be it long, short, broad, or
narrow. Altogether, it is a most satisfactory
sofa.</p>

<p class='c006'>But the satisfactoriness does not end
here. Seated at one end of that sofa is a
girl, clearly in that neither grass nor hay
period, which begins at sixteen and ends
at eighteen. Not that it is intended to suggest
that because the girl is neither hay
nor grass she is unattractive. Quite the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>reverse. New-mown hay is the sweetest,
and the girl, if neither child nor woman,
is, in her way, just as sweet.</p>

<p class='c006'>In algebra, when <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i> are computed,
it is possible to find the unknown
quantity <i>x</i>. Applying an algebraic formula
to the above, we at once deduce
what is necessary to complete the factors.
It may be stated thus: <i>a</i>, a sofa, plus <i>b</i>, a
charming girl; and as <i>a</i>, a sofa, must be
divided by two, we find the unknown
quantity to be <i>x</i>, a man, and the product
of our <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>x</i> to equal <i>xxx</i>, or triple
bliss. Nor is this wrong. The sofa does
not do more than seat two people comfortably,
yet at the present moment there
are little spaces at both ends. Concerning
the other details of this <i>a ÷ 2 + b + x − 0</i>
(<i>i. e.</i> Mrs. Grundy), it seems needless to
enlarge.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And isn’t it wonderful, Freddy, that
you should love me and I should love
you?” cooed the girl.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Just out of sight,” replied Freddy.</p>

<p class='c006'>Most people would agree with the above
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>remarks, though the circumstance of a
man and woman occasionally loving each
other is a phenomenon recognised, if not
approved, by science. But though these
two did not know it, there was a wonder
here. Freddy has been spoken of in the
masculine gender, because, as Shakespeare
wrote: “The Lord made him, therefore
let him pass for a man.” Otherwise his
manliness was open to debate. Lovable
the girl unquestionably was, or at least
very fast verging upon it, but it passeth
human intelligence how Freddy could inspire
any sort of feeling except an intense
longing for a gun loaded with goose-shot.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And that we should have loved each
other for so long, and never either of us
dreamed that we cared one little bit for
each other,” continued the girl.</p>

<p class='c006'>Freddy did not assent to this sentiment
as readily as to the former. Freddy had
been quite sure that Frances had been
pining for his love in secret for some
months. So he only remarked: “We got
there all the same.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>“Yes,” assented Frances. “And we’ll
love each other always, now.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But I say,” inquired Freddy, “what do
you think your father and mother will
say?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, they’ll be delighted,” cried the
girl. “It couldn’t be better. Cousins,—and
just the same age—and, and— Oh,
lots of other reasons, I’m sure, but I can’t
think of them now.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Let’s tell them together,” suggested
Freddy, courageously.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Freddy! Of course not. That isn’t
the right way. No, you must request an
interview with papa in his library, and
plead eloquently with him.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I suppose I must,” answered Freddy,
with a noticeable limpness in his voice and
vertebræ.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Wouldn’t it be fun if he should refuse
his consent!” exclaimed the girl.</p>

<p class='c006'>Freddy did not recognise the comical
quality. “I don’t see it,” he moaned.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, it would be so romantic! He
would of course order you to leave the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>house, and never, never darken his doors
again. That’s what the father always
does.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You think that’s fun?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Such fun! Then, of course, we should
have to arrange for romantic meetings,
and secret interviews, and you would write
little letters and put them in a prayer-book
in our pew; and watch to get a glimpse
of me as I go in and out of places; and
stand on the opposite side of the street
each night, till you saw the light in my
room put out. Oh! What fun it will be!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It might be raining,” complained
Freddy.</p>

<p class='c006'>“All the better. That would prove
your devotion. Don’t you love me
enough to do that?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes,” said Freddy, meekly, “but I hate
getting wet. Sometimes one catches a
nasty cold.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Any one who tells a girl he loves
her with a fervour and passion never yet
equalled by man should not think of such
things,” asserted Frances, disapprovingly.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>Freddy had an idea that a girl who reciprocated
such a passion should not seem
so happy over the prospect of her lover
undergoing the exposure, but the youth
did not know how to express it. So he
proposed: “Let’s keep it a secret for the
present.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Let’s,” assented Frances. “We won’t
tell any one for a long time, but just
have it all to ourselves. And when I
am riding in the morning you must join
me; the groom will think it’s all right.
And whenever papa and mama are to be
out in the evening, I’ll put a lamp in my
window, and—”</p>

<p class='c006'>Ting!</p>

<p class='c006'>It seemed as if some of the electric current
which made that distant muffled ring
had switched and passed through the
happy pair. Both started guiltily, and
then both listened with the greatest intentness;
so intensely, that after a moment’s
pause they could hear the soft
gliding sound of the footman’s list slippers
as they travelled down the hallway;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>could hear the click of the lock as he
opened the front door; could hear the murmur
of voices; could hear the door closed.
Then, after a moment’s silence, a voice, for
the first time articulate to them, said:
“I’ll wait in the morning room.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Freddy,” gasped the girl, “it’s that
horrid Mr. Potter. Quick!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Both had arisen from the sofa, and
Freddy looked about in a very badly perplexed
condition. He was quite willing,
but about what was he to be quick?</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sit down in that chair,” whispered
the girl, pointing to one at a more than
proper distance, and Freddy sprinted for
it, and sat down. The girl resumed her
seat on the little sofa, and putting her
hands in a demure position, rather contradictory
to her quick breathing and flushed
cheeks, began: “As you were saying,
the De Reszke brothers were the only
redeeming— Oh! Good evening, Mr.
Potter.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good evening, Frances,” responded a
tall, rather slender, strong-featured man,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>attired in evening dress, who had leisurely
strolled into the room, and who did not
offer to go through the form of shaking
hands. “Talking to the fire?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No. Freddy and I were chatting
about the opera.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Potter put on his glasses and languidly
surveyed the region of the fireplace.
Then he turned and extended his investigation,
till his eyes settled on Freddy,
stuck away in the dim distance.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, are you there, youngster?” he
remarked, in a tone of voice implying
that the question carried no interest with
it. He looked at his watch. “Isn’t it
rather late for you two?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s only quarter past ten,” answered
Frances, bristling indignantly. “And if it
were twelve it wouldn’t make any difference.”
To herself she said, “How I hate
that man! Just because he’s thirty-four,
he always treats us as if we were children;
and the way he tramples on poor, dear
Freddy is outrageous!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You don’t seem to be very sociably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>inclined,” said Mr. Potter. “From the
distance between you I should think you
two chicks had been quarrelling. Come,
make it up.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not at all,” cried Frances, indignantly.
“I never lose my temper; except when
you are here.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Is that the reason you haven’t asked
me to sit down?” asked Potter, smiling.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of course you are to sit down, if you
want,” exclaimed Frances. “Here.” And
she moved the four inches towards her end
of the sofa that had not been occupied
under the previous arrangement.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Potter seated himself leisurely in
Freddy’s old place, and arranged one of
the cushions to fit the small of his back.
“I came to say good-bye to your mother,”
he explained, “and as I’m too busy to
stop in to-morrow, I decided to wait. You
youngsters needn’t think it necessary to
sit up to entertain me. Won’t Freddy’s
mother be sending his nurse for him if he
stays much later?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m so glad you are going to Europe,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>remarked Frances. “I hope you’ll stay a
long while.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Potter put his glasses on again and
looked at Frances calmly. “Hello!” he
said mentally, “the kitten’s learning how
to hiss.” Aloud he announced: “I shall
only be gone for a month or two,—just
the voyage and a change.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What a pity!” responded Frances,
bitingly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I thought you’d miss me,” replied Mr.
Potter, genially.</p>

<p class='c006'>Frances gave an uneasy movement on
the sofa, a cross between an angry shake
of the shoulders and a bounce.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Where are you going?” questioned
Freddy at this point, feeling that as a
grown man he must bear his part of the
chat.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Look here, littleun,” said Mr. Potter,
“if you expect me to talk to you back
there, you—” At this point he suddenly
ceased speaking, as if something more
interesting than his unfinished remark had
occurred to him.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>“Freddy found it too warm by the fire,”
explained Frances hastily, guilty at heart,
if to outward appearance brazen. But
Mr. Potter did not hear what she said,
and sat looking into the fire with a suddenly
serious look, which nevertheless had
a laugh not very far underneath.</p>

<p class='c006'>After quite a pause, Frances said:
“How entertaining you are!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes,” assented Mr. Potter, coming
back from his thoughts; “I always enjoy
myself, and I find that other people do
the same.” Then he again relapsed into
meditation.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Isn’t he just as horrid as can be?”
raged Frances, inwardly. “He believes
just because some women think him clever,
and because men like him, and because he’s
a good business man, and because mama’s
always praising him to his face, as she would
any one who was papa’s partner, that he is
perfect. And no matter how you try to
snub him, he is so conceited that he won’t
see it. Horrid old thing!” Aloud she
asked, “What are you thinking about?”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>Mr. Potter laughed. “That’s a great
secret,” he asserted.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>⁂</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>An hour later, Mr. Potter was seated in
a library, smoking, with a glass of seltzer—and
something else—at his elbow. Opposite
to him sat a man of perhaps twice
his years, equally equipped with a cigar
and seltzer—and something else.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well,” remarked the senior, “I think
if we can get the whole issue at 82½ and
place them at 87 and accrued interest, we
had better do it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s settled then,” agreed Mr.
Potter. “Now, is there anything else? I
don’t want to have cablegrams following
me, since I’m going for a rest.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No,” replied the other. “I know I
shall want my partner’s advice often
enough, but I’ll get on without you. Take
a rest. You can afford it. There’s nothing
else.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then if you are through with business,
I want to speak to you of Frances,” said
Mr. Potter.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>Mr. De Witt turned and looked at Mr.
Potter quickly. “What about?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do you know that that girl’s grown
up, and we none of us have realised it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And do you know that she has seen
next to no people,—that her morning ride,
her studies, and her afternoon drive with her
mother are the only events of her day?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And that her summers, off in that
solitary country house of yours, with never
a bit of company but Freddy De Witt and
myself, are horribly dull and monotonous?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And that to kill time she reads a great
many more novels than is good for any
one?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Come, come, Champney, what are you
driving at?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“One more question. Mrs. De Witt and
you are dining out almost nightly. What
do you suppose Frances does evenings?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Does? Plays a bit, and reads a bit,
and goes to bed like a good child.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>“But I tell you she isn’t a child any
longer, so you can’t expect her to behave
like one. It dawned upon me this evening,
and the quicker it dawns upon you
the better.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do you want her to make a fool of
herself over Freddy?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Freddy!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, Freddy.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ridiculous! Impossible!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Because they are a long way towards
it, and if you want to end it, you’ll have
to use drastic measures.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Her own cousin, and only eighteen!
I never heard of such folly.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But I tell you those two think they
are in love with each other, and if you
don’t do something, they’ll really become
so before long. Thinking a thing is two-thirds
of the way to doing it, as is shown
by the mind cure.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ll put an end to it at once,” growled
Mr. De Witt. “Never heard of such nonsense.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>“And how will you end it?” inquired
Mr. Potter, smiling a little.</p>

<p class='c006'>“End it? Tell them to stop their foolishness.
Send him about his business.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I thought that would probably be your
way. Don’t you think it would be better
to get an injunction from the courts?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What good would an injunction do?”
asked Mr. De Witt, crossly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Just as much good as your method.
You can no more stop boys’ and girls’
love by calling it foolishness than the
courts can. If you do as you propose,
you’ll probably have a runaway match,
or some other awful bit of folly.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, what can I do?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“The best thing is to pack your trunks
and travel a bit. That will give her something
else to think about, and she’ll forget
all about the little chap.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But I can’t leave the business.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“The business will run itself. Or, if it
won’t, what’s a year’s profits compared to
your only daughter’s life happiness?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But the bonds?”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>“Don’t bid on them.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I can’t go. I can’t leave my business.
Why, I haven’t been away from it for
more than a week in forty years.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“All the more reason for going now.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have it. Her mother and she shall
sail with you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, get out!” ejaculated Champney,
“I’m going for a rest.” Mr. Potter had
been the slave for many years of two selfish
sisters and a whining mother,—a
mother who loved to whine,—and womankind
meant to him an absolute and entire
nuisance.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s it,” said the senior partner, regardless
of this protest. “You arrange to
stay for six months instead of two. I’ll
do your work gladly.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I can’t,” groaned Potter.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Come, Champney,” wheedled the elder,
“you say yourself that my little girl’s life
happiness depends on her going. For my
sake! Come! I did a good turn for you—or
at least you’ve always said I did—in
the partnership. Now do one for me.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>Potter sighed. He was used to being
martyrised where women were concerned
and had not learned how to resist. “Well,
if you say so. But I’ll have to leave them
there. Two months is my limit.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“All right,” assented the senior, gleefully.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Perhaps,” thought Potter, “perhaps
they won’t be able to pack in time.” And
the idea seemed to please him.</p>

<p class='c006'>For half an hour longer they chatted,
and then Potter rose.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Tell me, Champney,” inquired the
senior, “how did you find out about
it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh,” laughed Champney, “that’s telling.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>⁂</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The next day there was woe in Israel.
Mr. De Witt was cross over the “children’s
folly,” as he called it. Mrs. De
Witt was deeply insulted at such sudden
and peremptory marching orders. “Men
are so thoughtless,” she groaned; “as if one
could be ready to go on a day’s notice!”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>Champney was blue over the spoiling of
his trip. Freddy, when he heard the news,
was the picture of helplessness and misery,
and only added to the friction by coming
round and getting in everybody’s way, in
the rush of the packing. As for Frances,
she dropped many a secret tear into the
trunks as her belongings were bestowed
therein. Never, it seemed to her, had true
love been so crossed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I know Mr. Potter is at the bottom of
it.” (Frances was not alluding to the
trunk before which she knelt.) “He’s
always doing mean things, yet he never
will acknowledge them. He won’t even
pay me the respect of denying them.”
Frances slapped a shawl she was packing,
viciously. “To think of having to travel
with him! He won’t even look at me.
No. He doesn’t even pay me the compliment
of looking at me. I don’t believe
he’s even noticed my eyes and eyelashes.”
Frances gazed into a hand-glass she was
about to place in the trunk, and seemed
less cross for a moment after the scrutiny.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>“He’s just as snubby as he can be. I
hate snubby people, and I’ll be just as
snubby to him as I know how. I’ll—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good afternoon, Frances,” interrupted
a voice, which made that young lady nearly
jump into the trunk she was bending over.
“I came up to see if I could do anything
for you or your mother, and she sent me
in to ask you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Frances was rather flushed, but that
may have been due to the stooping position.
“I don’t think of anything,” she
answered.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ve had some chairs sent on board,
and laid in novels and smoked glasses and
puzzles; and oysters, and game, and fruit,
and butter,” said Champney, with a suggestion
of weariness, “and I don’t think of
anything else. If you can suggest something
more, I’ll get it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t know— Yes. You might
change your mind and let us stay at
home,” snapped Frances.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Don’t blame me for that,” laughed
Champney. “That’s your father’s doings.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>“I know you were at the bottom of it,”
charged Frances.</p>

<p class='c006'>“My dear child—” began Champney.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m not <i>your</i> child, and I’m not <i>a</i>
child, and I won’t be deared by you,” cried
Frances.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Madame Antiquity,” responded Champney,
bowing, “I assure you, that far from
wishing to force you to go on this trip with
me, I only agreed to take you, at your
father’s request, and at a great personal
sacrifice to myself.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Frances turned, and banged down the
lid of her trunk. Then she banged it
again, to get the hasp to fit. Then she
picked up a pair of discarded boots and
threw them across the room, hitting
Freddy, who entered at that moment.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, sweetness!” gasped Freddy,
who did not see Champney.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, go away,” cried Frances, blushing.
“Don’t bother me! Can’t you see I’m
too busy to waste time now?”</p>

<p class='c006'>And to illustrate the callousness of man
to true love, it is regrettable to state that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>Champney slipped out of the door at this
point, with an expression of great muscular
tension about his mouth, and no sooner
was he in the hall than the brute reeled
up against the wall and, leaning there,
laughed to a sinful degree.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then he walked to the end of the hall,
and entering a room, also cluttered with
trunks, he sat upon one of them and retold
the scene to the woman packing. “I
never saw anything so delicious in its way,”
he laughed. “I really believe the medicine’s
begun to work already. But do you
know, Frances promises to be a tremendous
beauty. Just now, when her cheeks and
eyes were blazing so, she was simply glorious
to look at.” Which shows that Champney’s
cool, disregarding manner was not
more than skin deep, and that unlimited
possibilities lay underneath. Perhaps, too,
another potion was beginning to work.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m sorry she is so childish with you,
Champney,” said Mrs. De Witt.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Don’t trouble yourself about that. I
really don’t mind it; indeed, I am afraid I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>rather enjoy it. It’s much rougher on her
than on me, for she really feels it, and it’s
the person who loses his or her temper
who suffers the most.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I hope the dear child will try to be
more amiable, for naturally she’s sweetness
itself, and it’s bad enough to be saddled
with us without making your trip worse
than need be. It’s so good of you to take
us!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Dear lady,” answered Champney, tenderly,
“it’s nothing but a little set-off
against your years of goodness to me.
You have really given me a second home;
nothing I can ever do will make me other
than your debtor.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s nice to hear you say so, Champney,”
said Mrs. De Witt, affectionately.
“I have always felt as if you were a son
of mine.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then don’t talk to me about my goodness
in taking you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But it is good of you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t think Freddy and Frances
think so.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>“Oh, Champney! Tell me, how did
you find out their foolishness?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That is a secret,” chuckled Champney,
“that goes with me to the grave.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>⁂</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Nor was it any better for Cupid the
next day at the steamer. The evil genius
of the little god, in the shape of Potter, persisted
in following Frances about, and not
a moment did she or Freddy find to swear
constancy or anything else to each other.
Only a hand squeeze, while the whistle was
blowing “all ashore,” did they get to feed
their hearts upon during the separation.</p>

<p class='c006'>Freddy went home, and, going to his
room, flung himself on his bed, and moaned,
and bit the pillow, and felt he was feeling
great thoughts, and thought he was having
great feelings.</p>

<p class='c006'>And the little lady?</p>

<p class='c006'>“No,” she declared, “I don’t want to
walk with you; I don’t want a steamer
chair; I don’t want anything; I only want
to be left al-o-o-o-o-ne,” and—running to
her stateroom, she flung herself upon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>lounge and wept over her unhappiness.
“Oh, Freddy, Freddy,” she sobbed, “only
be true to me, that’s all I ask.”</p>

<p class='c006'>But, alas, how is humanity constituted!
The next morning, Freddy, after a final
look at himself in a tall mirror, remarked
to the vision: “Yes, that’s very tony.
Now, I’ll take a walk on the Avenue,
so as to give the girls a treat.” As for
Frances, after an hour’s rapid walk with
Champney in the crisp, sunny air, she
came down to the breakfast-table, and said:
“Yes, steward, I’ll begin with fruit and oatmeal,
and then I’ll have chocolate, and beefsteak,
and an omelette, and fried potatoes,
and hot rolls, and marmalade. Oh! And,
steward, do you have griddle cakes?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus, despite their mutual intentions,
the thought of each other lessened daily,
till even the inevitable correspondence lost
interest and flagged. Frances discovered
that London, Paris, and the Riviera offered
greater attractions than Freddy’s witless
and vapid “chronicle of small beer;” while
Freddy found that listening to the conversation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>of a girl, present, was a far better
way of spending time than reading the
letters of a girl, absent. Finally, Frances
found a letter at the bankers at Berne
which ended the correspondence,—a letter
over which she laughed so heartily
that Champney looked up from his own
bundle of mail and asked, “What is it
that’s so funny?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Freddy’s engaged to Kitty Maxwell,”
replied Frances.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t think you ought to be so gleeful
at other people’s misfortunes,” reproved
Champney, laughing himself, however,
while speaking, as if he, too, saw something
humorous in the announcement.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I—I wasn’t—I was laughing at something
else,” Frances told him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What?” asked Champney.</p>

<p class='c006'>“A secret,” replied Frances, blushing a
little, even while laughing.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not from me?” urged Champney.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes; I sha’n’t even tell you. Not a
person in the world will ever know it, and
I’m very glad,” asserted Frances.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>“I suspect I know it already,” suggested
Champney. “I am a great hand at finding
out secrets. I have a patent method.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What is that?” asked Frances.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That, too, is a secret,” laughed
Champney.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>⁂</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>When next we meet any of our characters,
they—or at least two of them—are
toiling up a steep mountain path in the
Bavarian Tyrol. Frances leads, for the
way is narrow, and Champney follows.
Conversation is at a marked discount; but
whether this is due to the natural incompatibility
of the two, or merely to the
exertion of the climb, is unknown to
history.</p>

<p class='c006'>“She gets lovelier every day,” finally
remarked Champney.</p>

<p class='c006'>Frances stopped, and turned. “What
did you say?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I didn’t speak,” answered Champney.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m sure you did,” said Frances.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No,” denied Champney, “I was merely
thinking.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>“You did say something, I’m sure,” responded
Frances, turning, and resuming
the climb.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another five minutes brought them to
the top of a little plateau set in between
two ranges of mountains, and dividing two
lakes, famous the world over. Even after
the couple reached their destination, however,
they stood silent for a minute. Then
Frances exclaimed,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Isn’t it glorious?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Lovely,” assented Champney, emphatically,
but staring all the time at
Frances, making it doubtful of what he
was speaking.</p>

<p class='c006'>Frances, being quite conscious of this
gaze, looked all the harder at the view.
“The mountains shut in so grandly!” she
remarked, after a pause.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Such perfect solitude!” said Champney,
enthusiastically.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes,” assented Frances, with apparent
reluctance in admitting the fact. “But I
suppose we must be going down again;
mama will be lonely.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>Champney calmly seated himself on a
stone, unstrung his field-glass, and surveyed
through it the edge of the lake, far
below them. “Your mother,” he announced,
“is sitting on the rug, just where
we left her. Her back is against the tree,
and she is pretending to read. But she’s
doing nothing of the kind. She is taking
a nap on the sly. Surely you don’t want
to disturb her?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It must be nearly luncheon time.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“The boatmen haven’t even begun to
unpack yet. Johann is just taking the
Vöslauer out of the boat, to cool it in
the lake. They won’t be ready for half
an hour.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Frances began to look a little worried.
There was a dangerous persistence in this
evident desire to remain on the alp. “I
think I’ll go down, anyway,” she said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You mustn’t do that,” begged Champney,
laying the field-glass on the rock.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why not?” demanded Frances.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Because I have something to say to
you,” said Champney.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>Silence and apparent interest in the view
on the part of Frances.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do you know,” asked Champney,
“that I planned to be away for only two
months?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And that I have been over here more
than eight?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, not so long as that,” denied
Frances.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Eight months and four days.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“How quickly the time has gone!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But it has gone, and that’s the trouble.
I have decided that I <i>must</i> go back in
September.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Frances hesitated, and then said bravely,
“We shall be very sorry to have you go.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That makes it all the harder,” groaned
Champney, rising and joining Frances.
“In fact, I hate so to leave you” (“you”
can be plural or singular) “over here that—that
I want you to go back with me.
Will you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, that is for mama and papa to
settle,” remarked Frances, artfully dodging
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>the question, though perfectly understanding
it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“This isn’t to be settled by fathers
and mothers. My dar—my—I want
you to go—because you have become so
dear to me. I want to tell you—to tell
you how I have grown to love you in
these months. How happy you can make
me by a single word. I—you—once
you told me you were not ‘my dear child.’
Oh, Frances, won’t you be my dearest
love?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“If you want me to be,” acceded
Frances.</p>

<p class='c006'>One of the simplest laws of natural
philosophy is that a thing descends more
easily than it ascends. Yet it took those
two over four times longer to come down
than it had taken them to go up,—which
proves that love is superior to all the laws
of gravity; though it is not meant to
suggest by this that it has aught to
do with levity. From among a variety
of topics with which they beguiled this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>slow descent the following sentences are
selected:</p>

<p class='c006'>“I can’t believe it yet,” marvelled Champney.
“It doesn’t seem as if our happiness
could have depended on such a small
chance.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What chance?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why—on that evening. When I
found your mother wasn’t in, I half
turned away, but after hesitating, decided
to wait. And then, when I found you
two in the morning room, I decided that
I would leave you, and go and read in
the library. I was just about to say so,
when you told me to sit down by you
on the sofa. That led to our coming off
here together, and really finding out about
each other. Of course that was equivalent
to my falling desperately in love.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But you could have done that at
home,” laughed Frances, merrily.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, I should have come off here, and
some other man would have won you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Champney! I never could love any
one but you.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>Champney swallowed the absurd statement
rapturously. “That’s just like the
angel that you are,” he declared.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But I knew you had something to
do with our coming,” asserted Frances,
“though you did deny it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No; like a consummate donkey, I
didn’t want to be bothered with you.
Conceive of it, dear one, that I could
ever think you a bother!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You didn’t know me,” laughed
Frances happily, and with no intention
of vanity.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, I should think not. I wanted
your father to take you. But I shall never
want any one else to do that in the future.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But why did you want me to go to
Europe, if it wasn’t to be with me?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why—um—because, dear one, I
saw a little girl that night who was longing
so for love that she was accepting a
cheap and flashy counterfeit in its stead.
I didn’t want her to waste a real heart on
such an apology for a man, and so I
interfered.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>“But how did you know?” cried
Frances, looking bewildered. “We had
only just—you couldn’t have known it
then?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“How?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Champney laughed as he replied:
“That’s telling.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>⁂</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>And now, another leap, please, back to
that fireplace, and sofa, again occupied by
two—but not the same two—or, at least,
only half the same.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well,” groaned Champney, “I suppose
I ought to be going, for you must look
your prettiest to-morrow, otherwise malicious
people will say it’s a match arranged
for the business.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Let them,” laughed Frances. “By
the way, how have you arranged about
that? You are such a good business
man, and papa and mama are so delighted,
that I know you have the best of it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of course I have. And she’s sitting
beside me now. But nothing mercenary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>to-night, Madam,” ordered Champney.
“Cupid, not cupidity.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, Champney, dear, at least do tell
me how you found out about—about—”
Frances stopped there.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Never,” persisted Champney, nestling
back on the sofa and laughing.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t think it’s nice for a man to
have secrets from his wife,” reproved
Frances, taking an eminently feminine
view of man’s knowledge.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That is to be,” corrected Champney.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Will you tell me—after to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s too good to be told.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah, Champney!” And a small hand
strayed round his neck, and rested lightly
against his cheek. Champney looked very
contented.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Please, dear.” And a pair of lips came
dangerously close to his own.</p>

<p class='c006'>Champney groaned a satisfied groan.
“Well,” he began, “do you remember
when I came in the evening before we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>sailed, how Freddy was sitting over there,
and you were sitting just where you
are?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And how you let me sit down here,
just where I am?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And how I chatted for a moment and
then suddenly became silent?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That was when I discovered it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“How?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I found that the seat I was sitting in
was <i>warm</i>!”</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>“Oh, my dear!” cried her mother.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I hope you have properly considered?
He is charming, of course, but—well—he
is such a club habitué.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What? Well, well!” exclaimed her
father. “Bless me, Meg, I had no idea— Give
me a kiss, if you have any to spare
for your old dad now. Why, of course,
I consent, if you care for him. Only tell
Mr. Tyler I hear he spends too much time
at his clubs.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Margaret! How nice!” ejaculated her
sister. “I’ve liked him from the start,
and hoped—people said he was too fond
of his club ever to care to marry, and so
I thought—but now it’s all right.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I knew he meant biz,” asserted her
brother, “the moment he began to keep
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>away from the club, and put in so much
time with you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I cannot tell you, my dearest Margaret
(if I may call you that?),” wrote his
mother, “how happy I am over what my
dear boy has just told me. The luxury
and ease of club life are now so great that
I had almost feared Harry could not be
weaned from them. But since he has
chosen such a dear, beautiful, and clever
girl, my worst anxiety is over.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You are indeed to be congratulated,
niece,” declared her aunt. “He is a most
eligible <i><span lang="la">parti</span></i>—good looks, position, and
wealth. If you can only keep him away
from his clubs, I am confident you will
be a very happy and domestic couple.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have been certain of it for weeks,”
her dearest feminine friend assured her.
“There isn’t a man I would rather have
had you take, for he is so much at his
club that I shall still see something of
you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Er, Miss Brewster,” said one of her
rejected lovers, “let me offer you my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>best wishes. At the club we all swear by
Harry, and we actually think of going into
mourning over the loss. Er, the fellows
are laying bets as to whether we shall ever
see him there again. The odds are six
to one on the club,—but the fellows don’t
know you, you know.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I want to offer you my heartiest congratulations,”
gushed the girl who had
tried for him. “Mr. Tyler has always been
one of my best friends, and I am sure you
will be very happy. He isn’t, of course,
very fond of women’s society, but— Have
you asked him to resign from his clubs?”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>⁂</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Don’t you want to sit down, Harry?”
asked Margaret, making room on the little
sofa beside the fire.</p>

<p class='c006'>The young couple had enjoyed four
months of ecstatic travel, thirty days of
chaos while they settled their household
goods, and then a recurring Indian-summer
honeymoon of two months in front of
their own fireside in the charmingly cosey
library where the above remark was made.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>Upon this particular evening, however,
Harry, in following his wife from the dining-room,
took neither his customary seat
beside his wife on the sofa nor lighted a
cigar. On the contrary, he stood leaning
against the mantel with anything but an
expression or attitude of ease, and, noting
this, Margaret had asked her question.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not to-night, dear,” said Harry. “The
truth is—well—I met Parmlee on my
way up town, and I—that is—he asked
me to come round to the club this evening—and,
well—I didn’t like to disappoint
him. And then, a fellow mustn’t stag—that
is—don’t you think, my darling, that
it’s a mistake for married people to see
too much of each other—and—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, Harry!” cried Margaret, interrupting
and rising. “You said you never
could have enough—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And I can’t, dearest,” interrupted
Harry, hurriedly. “But you know— Well—can’t
you—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I feel as if it were the beginning of the
end,” said Margaret, wildly.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>“Now, my darling,” pleaded Harry,
“do be reasonable. You know— There,
don’t cry. I won’t go. Sit down here
and let me tell you how much I love
you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>This occupied some time, but the clock
never told on them, so it is impossible to say
just how long. Presently Margaret said:</p>

<p class='c006'>“Harry, did you really want to—to
leave me?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not a bit,” lied Harry. “It was only
to keep my word to Parmlee.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I suppose it’s too late now?” questioned
Margaret, hopefully.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Late? Oh, no! Fun’s just beginning.
But I’m going to stay with you,
sweetheart.”</p>

<p class='c006'>There was a moment’s silence, and then
Margaret said: “If you want to go, I want
you to do it, Harry.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well,” responded Harry, rising, “if
you insist, dearest.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I do,” assented Margaret, in the most
faint-hearted of voices.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s a darling!” said her husband.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>“It’s half-past nine, so you’ll only have a
few minutes of loneliness before you go to
bed.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I sha’n’t go to bed, Harry,” sighed
Margaret, dolefully.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, my darling,” protested Harry, a
little irritably, “you don’t want to make
me miserable thinking of you as here by
yourself. Please be reasonable and don’t
sit up for me. Leave me free to come
home when I want.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Very well, Harry,” acceded Margaret,
dutifully, “if you insist I won’t wait for
your return.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Harry took the charming face in his
hands, and kissed each eyelid, and then
the lips. “I don’t deserve such an angel,”
he asserted, his conscience pricking him,
“and— Oh, hang Parmlee!” he growled,
as her eyes, a little misty, looked up
into his own. However, she belonged to
him, and there were plenty of evenings,
and—well— “Good-night, my treasure,”
he ended.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>⁂</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>Margaret remained standing where
Harry had left her until she heard the
front door close; then she collapsed on
the sofa and softly sobbed her sense of
desertion and grief into the pillow. The
warnings of her family and friends recurred
to her, and added to the pain of the
moment a direful dread of the future.
Not knowing that most bachelors are
regular club men merely because it is the
nearest approach to home life they can
attain, she dwelt on his having been apparently
wedded to these comforters of
men, before marriage, and inferred a return
to his former daily frequenting of
them.</p>

<p class='c006'>Her grief was keen enough to prevent
her from noticing that the front door was
presently opened, and not till she heard a
faint cough in the room did she raise her
head from the pillow. It was to find a
servant with his back turned to the sofa,
occupied, apparently, in setting a chair in
a position entirely unsuited to it,—a proceeding
he made far more noisy than became
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>a well-trained butler, and which he
accompanied with two more coughs.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hurriedly wiping her eyes, Margaret
asked, “What is it, Craig?”</p>

<p class='c006'>With his eyes carefully focussed to see
everything but his mistress’s face, the man
came forward and held out his tray.</p>

<p class='c006'>Almost mechanically she took the card
upon it, and after a mere glance she
directed,—“Say that Mrs. Tyler is not
receiving this evening, and begs to be
excused.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Left alone once more, the young wife sat
down upon a stool near the fire, and looked
into the blaze, idly twirling the card. “I
wonder,” she soliloquised presently, “if he
would have done the same.” Again she
lapsed into meditation, for a few minutes;
then suddenly she sat up straight, with an
air of sudden interest which was clearly
derived from her own thoughts. A moment
later, she gave a short, hesitating
laugh. “If I only dared! I wonder if
he would? Men are—” she said disconnectedly;
but even as she spoke, her face
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>softened. “Poor dear!” she murmured
tenderly. Yet the words of pity melted
into another laugh, and this time merriment
and not guilt was as the dominant note.
Springing to her feet with vivacity, she
sped into the hall, and placed the card on
the tray, and that in turn conspicuously
on the hatrack. A second action consisted
in turning on all the electric lights
of the chandelier. This done, she touched
the bell.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You may close the house, Craig,” she
ordered, when the servant responded to the
summons, “but as Mr. Tyler has gone to
his club, I wish you to leave these lights
just as they are. I prefer that he should
not come home to a darkened house, so
don’t turn out one.” Giving one last
glance, half merry and half guilty, at the
bit of pasteboard put in so prominent a
position, Margaret lightly tripped upstairs,
humming something to herself.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>⁂</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Meantime Harry had wended his way
to the club.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>“Hello, Tyler!” said the man his wife
had refused. “Don’t mean to say you’ve
actually ceased to be one of the ‘submerged
tenth?’ How and where is your superior
moiety?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“When I left Mrs. Tyler before her fire,
ten minutes ago, she was very well.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“By George, if I had as clever and
pretty a wife I don’t think I should dare
to leave her alone. I should be afraid of
the other men.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Harry turned away to hide his frown,
but as he went towards the door of
the billiard room, rejoined: “Perhaps it
wouldn’t be safe with <i>your</i> wife.” To
himself he carolled gleefully: “That cuts
both ways.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But you are not afraid, I understand,”
called the man, irritatingly, “so I take it
you won’t mind if I drop round there for a
few moments this evening, eh?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Certainly not,” responded Harry,
suavely, but gritting his teeth. “Hang the
fellow,” he muttered. “How do such cads
ever get into decent clubs? As if Margaret’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>refusing him twice wasn’t enough
to make him understand that she doesn’t
want him round!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Tyler’s anger was quickly forgotten in
the warm reception his cronies gave him,
and a tumbler of “unsweetened” and a
cue quickly made him forget both the
incident and the passing hours. Not till
the marker notified the players that the
time limit had come did he wake to the
fact that it was two o’clock.</p>

<p class='c006'>With a sense of guilt the husband hurried
home. In the hallway, as he took off
hat and coat, he noticed the card, and
picked it up. “So he did come,” he
growled, with a frown. “I hope Meg had
gone to bed before he got here. Not, of
course, that it really matters,” he went on.
“She told me she never could endure
him, so he’s welcome to call as often
as he likes to be snubbed.” To prove
how little he cared, the husband crushed
the card viciously, and tossed it on the
floor.</p>

<p class='c006'>The light in Margaret’s room was burning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>low, Harry noticed when he had ascended
the stairs, and, peeping in, he saw
that she was sleeping peacefully. Entering
quietly, he looked at her for a moment,
thinking with a little pang that he had
given her pain. “You don’t deserve such
an angel,” he said aloud. “See how she
has done just what you asked her to do,
with never a word of— There isn’t another
woman who would have taken it so
sweetly. You’re an ass! And for what?
Four hours of—of nothing, when I might
have been with her.” He leaned down to
very softly kiss a stray curl, and went
towards his own room, while saying:
“How pretty and dainty she is! She’s
worth all the clubs in the world!” What
was more, for a minute he believed it.</p>

<p class='c006'>The moment Harry was gone Margaret
opened her eyes very wide, rose softly,
and looked at the clock. Then she
went back to bed, smiling demurely.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>⁂</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The next morning, when Harry entered
the breakfast room a little late, he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>received with a kiss, and no word of
reproach. Margaret chatted over the meal
in her usual entertaining, happy mood, telling
him the news she had already extracted
from the morning’s paper.</p>

<p class='c006'>“She’s too clever ever to nag a man,”
thought Harry, and assured that he was
not to be taken to task, he became equally
amiable, and told her whom he had seen
at the club, and of his score.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m glad you had such a pleasant evening!”
said Margaret, sweetly. “I hope
you didn’t stay so late as to tire yourself.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I didn’t notice the time,” fibbed Harry,
“but probably I was in by twelve.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, no, dear,” said Margaret, pleasantly,
“for I didn’t get home till after one
myself, and you weren’t back then.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>⁂</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Twenty times Harry has tried to persuade
his wife into acknowledging that
she spoke in jest, but Margaret only looks
at him with wideopen, questioning eyes,
as innocent as a child’s. Her husband
firmly believes that she went to bed ten
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>minutes after he left the house, and always
ends his unsuccessful attempts to get her
to confess the fact by taking Margaret in
his arms and telling her of his belief.
This faith his wife rewards with a tender
kiss, but only a kiss, and still maintains
her demure silence.</p>

<p class='c006'>Harry spends no more evenings at the
club, and every woman who knows him
holds him up to other men as an ideal
married Benedick.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>It could never have happened to us
anywhere in New York but at Mrs.
Baxter’s. I say this not with bitterness at,
but in calm recognition of, the merits and
demerits of that universally esteemed lady.
Abroad, with the lords chamberlain, herald’s
offices, and peerages, it would be
impossible. In the far West, where the
biography and genealogy of the leading
families are not subjects for polite conversation,
it might occur frequently. But
in New York, lying between these two
extremes, one is safe, except from accidents
due to the unfortunate existence of
a peculiar class of people.</p>

<p class='c006'>The kind I refer to are those described
as having a good heart. Such an organ
involves, as a natural corollary, a weak
head. These qualities in combination are
a terrible menace to society; for, owing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>to the very goodness of heart, their possessors
are pardoned over and over again, and
repeat their ill deeds with as much immunity
from punishment as a New York
police captain. Every social circle has
one or more of these half-criminals, and in
that in which my lot was cast Mrs. Baxter
was unequalled for the number, ingenuity,
and innocence of her mistakes. Omitting
all hearsay and they-say knowledge, I was
her forty-seventh victim; and as pœnologists
affirm that more than half of the
criminal acts are undiscovered, it can at
once be seen how society is menaced by
people with good hearts.</p>

<p class='c006'>The lady who always tells me when I
do wrong—and to married men I need
not be more descriptive—has held me
responsible for that evening; and, since
she married me, her husband is not the
one to impeach her discrimination. She
insists that, knowing Mrs. Baxter, I should
have come early, and so had time to arrange
matters quietly. I appeal to any
man if it would ever occur to him to get
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>to a dinner early on the possibility he
was to sit next a lighted shell, in order
that he might express to his hostess his
dislike of explosives. All New York
has known for years of our family feud.
It’s been common property ever since our
esteemed ancestors thrashed it out in
court, to the enjoyment of the public and
the disruption of our family. For thirty
years dinners, luncheons, yacht cruises, and
house parties have been arranged so as
to keep a proper distance between the descendants
of my grandfather John Cortelyou
and of his nephew Dabney. Sometimes
I have seen one of the latter at the
opposite end of a large dinner-table, and
here and there I have had other glimpses
of them. But until that evening, no
matter how close chance brought us together,
we had always succeeded in maintaining
a dignified unconsciousness of
each other’s existence.</p>

<p class='c006'>I was, let it be confessed, thirty minutes
late, and merely accepting the last little
envelope on the tray the footman offered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>me, hurried towards the drawing-room.
On my way I naturally looked at the card
inside and read:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><i>Mr. Pellew.</i></div>
    <div><i>Miss Cortelyou.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>That meant nothing to me. The name is
not an uncommon one, and I have taken
in my aunts often enough to get accustomed
to the occurrence, even in the
family. So, without a second thought of
the matter, I passed through the doorway
and discharged my devoirs with Mrs.
Baxter.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I was on the point of suicide, thinking
you had failed me,” she said. “As it is,
Mr. and Mrs. Dana have just sent me word
that they can’t come because Milly has
croup.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“My note said half after seven,” I stated
boldly. When one is very late it is always
best to put one’s hostess in the wrong, and
a mistake more or less to Mrs. Baxter was
immaterial.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, never!” she declared, so guiltily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>that I was really sorry for her. “Well,
we can’t discuss it now. We were just
going in without you, and we’ll go on,
leaving you to find your partner by the
process of elimination. I haven’t left you
Hobson’s choice, however.”</p>

<p class='c006'>I glanced round, and as the couples had
gravitated together, I easily picked out the
only single figure left, and went towards
it. She was turned from me, standing by
Ferdie Gallaudet and his partner, who had
not yet moved.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That back is too young and pretty
for Aunt Ellen or Madge,” was my first
thought. My second was a spoken one,
and merely consisted of the trite, “I am
to have the pleasure, Miss Cortelyou.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She was saying something to the girl,
and went on saying it, with her head over
her shoulder, even as she rested her hand
on my arm and let me lead her away.
And just as I was going to look at her, I
caught sight of Ferdie’s face, and fell to
wondering what could ail him that he
looked so queer. We had been close to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>the door, and before she had finished her
remark, or I had ceased from wondering,
we were through it and in the half-gloom
of the hall.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I beg your pardon,” said she, turning
to me, and speaking very sweetly. “It
was a message, and I had only just begun
when you came.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What a nuisance messages are!” was
my remark. “What a nice voice you
have!” was my thought. Then we entered
the dining-room, and I glanced at my
partner. It was Kate Cortelyou!</p>

<p class='c006'>She looked at me at the same moment,
and as our eyes met, an expression of
consternation appeared on both our faces.
At least, that’s what I felt in myself and
saw in her. Horror succeeded as a next
sensation and expression. Womanlike,
she cast her eyes appealingly towards her
hostess, and, manlike, I took a step towards
the hall door. In another second I
think I should have bolted, but just then
Ferdie Gallaudet said, “Here’s your seat,
Jack,” with a grin like a Cheshire cat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>on his face. I looked at Kate and she
looked at me. Then we both looked at the
chairs. Mechanically I stepped to them
and pulled out that on the right of mine.
Kate’s eyelashes fluttered for a moment,
as if she were hesitating; then she slipped
into the seat, and the next moment I
was sitting beside her. But enchantingly
pretty as I thought her (and I was
either too fair-minded or she was too
beautiful for me not to acknowledge it,
however much I might dislike to do so),
I could only wish I had broken my leg
on my way to the house.</p>

<p class='c006'>I turned to my left to see if any escape
were possible, but my neighbour on that
side was that horrible perpetual motion
of a Mrs. Marvin, and, besides, she was
very properly occupied with her partner.
I peered furtively behind Kate to see if
she could escape me, for anything was
better than the alternative. Next her
were two empty seats. Mrs. Baxter’s
capacity for social blundering had done
its worst.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>There is this to be said for the Cortelyou
women, whether friends or enemies: I’ve
never seen one show the white feather in
action. Just as I was preparing to collapse
under this accumulation of horrors, Kate
turned to me, with the friendliest of smiles,
and murmured,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s ghastly, but every one except Mrs.
Baxter is watching us.”</p>

<p class='c006'>I took a furtive glimpse of the other
guests. They were all pretending to talk,
but all clearly were missing nothing of our
<i><span lang="fr">tableau vivant</span></i>. Wasn’t she clever to have
seen it so quickly?</p>

<p class='c006'>“They hope we’ll make a show of the
family for their benefit,” I growled.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Can’t we—” suggested Kate, and then
hesitated, and blushed very prettily. The
Cortelyou women are plucky, but Kate
was only nineteen.</p>

<p class='c006'>I never was good as leader, but at the
shafts I’m steady and reliable. “Of course
we can,” I responded, won by that blush.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Don’t frown, then,” smiled Kate.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I was not frowning at you,” I protested.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>“But they’ll think you are,” she replied.</p>

<p class='c006'>I tried to appear as pleased as Kate so
successfully pretended to be, and she rewarded
me with an encouraging “That’s
better,” and a very refreshing look at her
eyes.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now,” she continued, “how can we
do it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m pretty well up on the litany,” I
whispered. “If you can do the supplications
I can respond with the ‘miserable
sinner’ part.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Kate laughed merrily, even while shaking
her head reprovingly. Kate has nice teeth.
“You are painfully frank,” she told me.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Frank?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes. You are probably not a bit more
miserable than I am, but I don’t groan
aloud.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, I say!” I exclaimed, rather horrified
at the construction my speech had
been given. “It would be pure form, you
know, quite as it is in church, and not
mean a bit more than it does when the
sinner’s pretty and wears a French gown.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>Kate drew her mouth down into a
church-going expression, which was very
fetching in its demureness, but which
wasn’t suitable for our public performance,
so I remarked:</p>

<p class='c006'>“Don’t look so disapproving. The
saintly vein suits the Madonna type, but
the Cortelyou forte lies in quite another
direction.”</p>

<p class='c006'>I won another laugh from those unsaintly
lips. “You are worse than I
thought,” she added.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then you have thought of me?” I inquired,
beginning to mellow under her
laugh. That was a mistake, for her face
instantly became serious, and her eyes
gave a flash.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What I think is my own concern,” she
responded. The Cortelyou women are
stunning when they look haughty.</p>

<p class='c006'>Being one of the family, however, I am
too accustomed to the look to be as entirely
crushed by it as others are. “Who’s
frowning now?” I asked. I thought I’d
learn what kind of a temper Kate had.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>She still smiled as if she liked being put
next me, but her eyes gleamed, and I knew
she’d pay me for my speech if the opportunity
occurred.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We can’t begin like this,” she said.
“Suggest something else.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I once heard of a poor couple in an English
county who were always sitting next
each other, so they agreed to count alternative
tens up to a thousand,” I answered.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m afraid you haven’t enough facial
control for that,” replied Kate, sweetly,
appearing the picture of contentment.
I thought her remark unnecessary, considering
we had been face to face only a few
minutes, and that she had just lost control
of hers.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then suggest something yourself,” I
muttered.</p>

<p class='c006'>“As the photographer says, ‘A little
more smile, please,’” corrected Kate.
“Yes, you unquestionably have the Cortelyou
temper,” she added serenely.</p>

<p class='c006'>“If I had,” I asserted, “I should long
since have turned to Mrs. Marvin, who is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>dying for a listener.” I thought I’d let
Kate understand <i>I</i> wasn’t sitting next two
empty chairs.</p>

<p class='c006'>She realised my advantage, but she
wouldn’t retreat. The Cortelyou women
never do. Yet she knew enough to allow
the honours of war to a hard-driven enemy.
“The Cortelyou men are gentlemen,” she
said. Wasn’t that a neat way of telling
me that I would never fail a woman in
distress? I felt pleased that she understood
the family so well as to have no fear
for the conduct of even her bitterest
enemy. “Besides,” she continued, “I like
the Cortelyou temper.”</p>

<p class='c006'>I raised my eyebrows.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes,” she persisted, “it’s an absolutely
reliable factor. Now, papa—” Then she
hesitated, realising the slip.</p>

<p class='c006'>With an older girl I should have let her
flounder, and enjoyed it; but she was
so young, and blushed so charmingly that
I had to help her out. “Don’t keep me in
suspense about your father,” I said, in
my most interested of tones, as if I truly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>wished to know something of that blot on
the ‘scutcheon. This was my second mistake,
and a bad one.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We’ll leave Mr. Dabney Cortelyou
out of the conversation, please,” she retorted,
looking me in the eyes. Was there
ever a meaner return for an act of pure
charity than that?</p>

<p class='c006'>By the way, Kate’s eyes are not Cortelyou.
I wondered from where she got them.
When we are angry we contract ours,
which is ugly. She opens hers, which is—I
tried to make her do it again by saying,
“You should set a better example,
then.” No good: she had got back to her
form, and was smiling sweetly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“They are furiously disappointed so
far,” she remarked.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What an old curiosity shop the world
is about other people’s affairs! It’s no
concern of theirs that my grandfather and
your”—I faltered, and went on—“that
my grandfather had a row in his family.
We don’t talk of it.” When I said “we”
I meant the present company, but unfortunately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>Kate took it to mean our faction,
and knowing of her father’s idle blabbing,
she didn’t like it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Your side has always dodged publicity,”
she affirmed viciously, though smiling
winsomely. Kate’s smile must be her
strong card.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We have maintained a dignified
silence,” I responded calmly; but I knew
that a dagger thrust below that beautifully
modelled throat would be less cruel.</p>

<p class='c006'>She tried to carry the wound bravely.
“My father is quite justified in letting the
truth be known,” she insisted.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then why don’t you, too, give public
house-warmings in the family-skeleton
closet?” I inquired blandly. That was
really a triumph, for Kate had never talked
to outsiders about the wretched business.
She couldn’t even respond with what she
thought; for if she said that it was always
the side in the wrong which talked, she
was no better off, because we, like her,
had kept silence, but her father had chattered
it all over town. She looked down,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>and I gloated over her silence, till suddenly
I thought I saw a suggestion of
moisture on her down-turned lashes.
What I said to myself was not flattering,
and moreover is not fit for publication.
What I said aloud I still glow over with
pride when it recurs to memory.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Beware of the croquette!” I exclaimed
hastily. “I’ve just burned my tongue horribly.”
And I reached for the ice-water.</p>

<p class='c006'>She was as quick as I had been. The
Cortelyou girls are quick, but she—well,
I think the ancestress who gave her those
eyes must have been a little quicker.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You spoke a moment too late,” she
replied, looking up at me. “I had just
done the same, and feel like weeping.”
I wonder what the recording angel wrote
against those two speeches?</p>

<p class='c006'>Then suddenly Kate began to laugh.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What is it?” I queried.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Taste your croquette,” she suggested.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was as cool as it should have been
hot!</p>

<p class='c006'>We both laughed so heartily that Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>Baxter called, “Come; don’t keep such a
good story to yourselves.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Pretend you are so engrossed that you
didn’t hear,” advised Kate, simulating
the utmost interest. “Aren’t we doing
well?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Thanks to you,” was my gallant
reply.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Thanks to the Cortelyous,” she declared.</p>

<p class='c006'>“They might have known,” said I, “that
we’d never have a public circus to please
them.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Isn’t it nice,” she responded, “since
we had to have a fracas, that it should be
between ladies and gentlemen?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Isn’t it?” I acceded. “Just supposing
there had been some cad concerned,
who would have written to the papers and
talked to reporters!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That was impossible, because we are
all Cortelyous,” explained Kate. I like a
girl who stands up for her stock.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes,” I assented. “And that’s the
one advantage of family rows.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>“I want to tell you,” she went on, “that
you do my father a great injustice. Some
natures are silent in grief or pain, and
some must cry out. Because he talks,
merely means that he suffers.”</p>

<p class='c006'>I longed to quote her remark about
leaving her father out of the conversation,
but having told her there were no cads in
the family, the quotation was unavailable.
So I merely observed, “Not knowing Mr.
Dabney Cortelyou, I have had no chance
to do him justice.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But what you hear—” she began,
with the proudest of looks; and it really
hurt me to have to interrupt her by
saying,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Since I only get word of him from his
dearest friends I am forced to take a somewhat
jaundiced view of him.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I suppose you are surrounded by
toadies who pretend to know him,” she
said contemptuously.</p>

<p class='c006'>I was not to be made angry. I was
enjoying the dinner too much. “It would
be a very terrible thing for our mutual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>friends,” I continued, “if the breach were
ever healed, and we exchanged notes as to
their tattling.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Fortunately they are in no danger,”
she answered, more cheerfully—indeed I
might say, more gleefully—than it seemed
to me the occasion required.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Fortunately,” I agreed, out of self-respect.
Then I weakened a little by adding,
“But what a pity it is you and I didn’t
have the settling of that farm-line!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“My father could not have acted otherwise,”
she challenged back.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And the courts decided that my grandfather
was right.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I should have done just as he did,”
she replied.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then you acknowledge my grandfather
was right?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I!”—indignantly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You just assured me you should have
done as he did!” I teased, laughing. “No.
Of course both of them were justified in
everything but in their making a legal
matter a family quarrel. If we had had it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>to do, it would have been done amicably, I
think.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What makes you so sure?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Because I am sweet-tempered, and
you—”</p>

<p class='c006'>She wouldn’t accept a compliment from
an enemy, so interrupted me with, “My
father has one of the finest natures I have
ever known.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Physician, know thyself,’” I quoted,
getting in the compliment in spite of her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s more than you do,” she replied
merrily.</p>

<p class='c006'>This could be taken in two ways, but I
preferred to make it applicable to her
rather than to myself. I said, “Our
acquaintance has been short.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But we know all about the stock,” she
corrected.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m proud of the family,” I acknowledged;
“but don’t let’s be Ibsenish.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I knew you didn’t like him,” said Kate,
confidentially. “I don’t either.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“He’s rather rough on us old families,”
I intimated.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>“Sour grapes,” explained Kate. “The
wouldn’t-because-I-can’t-be people always
stir up the sediments of my Cortelyou
temper.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I thought you liked the family temper,”
I suggested.</p>

<p class='c006'>“In anybody but myself,” she told me.
“With others it’s really a great help.
Now, with my brothers, I know just how
far I can go safely, and it’s easy to manage
them.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I suppose that accounts for the ease
with which you manage me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She laughed, and replied demurely,
“I think we are both on our good
behaviour.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m afraid our respective and respected
parents won’t think so.”</p>

<p class='c006'>This made her look serious, and I wondered
if her father could be brute enough
ever to lose that awful temper of his at
such a charming daughter. The thought
almost made me lose mine. “They
can’t blame you,” I assured her. “Your
father—”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>“Is sure that everything I do is right,”
she interjected, “but Mrs. Pellew?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“We will not make Mrs. Pellew—”</p>

<p class='c006'>Kate saw I was going to use her own
speech, and she interrupted in turn. “Of
course you are over twenty-one,” she
continued, “but the Cortelyou women
always have their way. I hope she won’t
be very bad to you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She certainly had paid me off, and to
boot, for my earlier speech. And the
nasty thing about it was that any attempt
to answer her would look as if I
felt there was truth in her speech, which
was really ridiculous. Though I live with
my mother, my friends know who is the
real master of the house.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Any one living with a Cortelyou woman
must confess her superiority,” I responded,
bowing deferentially.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes,” she said, nodding her head knowingly.
“People say that she spoils you.
Now I see how you compass it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“We have only exchanged Ibsen for
Mrs. Grundy,” I complained.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>“‘Excelsior’ is a good rule,” announced
Kate.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s what you’ll be doing in a
moment,” said I, trying to look doleful,
for we were eating the game course.</p>

<p class='c006'>“How well you act it!” replied Kate.
“You ought to go on the stage. What a
pity that you should waste your time on
clubs and afternoon teas!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Look here,” I protested, “I’ve done
my best all through dinner, considering
my Cortelyou temper, and now, just because
it’s so nearly over that you don’t
need me any longer is no reason for making
such speeches. I don’t go to my
club once a week, and I despise afternoon
teas.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That sampler has become positively
threadbare,” retorted Kate. “I really think
it must be worked in worsted, and hung
up in all the New York clubs, like ‘God
bless our home!’ and ‘Merry Christmas!’”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I much prefer hearts to clubs, for a
steady trump,” I remarked.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You play billiards, I presume?”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>“Yes,” I innocently replied.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What’s your average run?”</p>

<p class='c006'>It was a tempting bait she shoved
under my nose, but I realised the trap;
and was too wary to be caught. “Oh,
four, when I’m in good form.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Really?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Really.” I did not choose to add that
I was talking of the balk-line game, not
caring to be too technical with a woman.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s very curious!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I suppose some devoted friend of mine
has told you I’m only a billiard-marker?”
I inquired.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No—but—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nothing.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“George Washington became President
by always telling the truth.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s the advantage of being a woman,”
replied Kate. “We don’t have to
scheme and plot and crawl for the Presidency.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“How about spring bonnets?” I mildly
insinuated.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>“Does your mother have a very bad
time persuading you to pay for hers?”
laughed Kate, mischievously.</p>

<p class='c006'>I didn’t like the question, though I
knew she was only teasing, so I recurred
to my question. “You haven’t told me
what that ‘nothing’ was,” I persisted.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I oughtn’t,” urged Kate.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then I know you will,” I said confidently.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, Seymour Halsey said to Weedon
the other night, ‘I wish you could play
with Jack Pellew, so as to knock some of
his airs out of him!’”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why,” I ejaculated, “I could play
cushion caroms against your brother’s
straight game and beat him then!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I never did believe that story about
George Washington,” asserted Kate, with
a singular want of relevance.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No woman could,” I answered, squaring
accounts promptly.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here I saw the little preliminary flutter
among the ladies, and knowing that I
should never speak to Kate again, I said:</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>“Miss Cortelyou, I’m afraid an unkind
remark of mine a little while ago gave you
pain. You’ve probably forgotten it already,
but I never shall cease to regret I
made it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Don’t think of it again,” she replied,
kindly, as she rose. “And thank you for
a pleasant evening.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Don’t blame me for that,” I pleaded
hastily. “It was your own fault.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not entirely,” denied Kate. “We did
it so well that I’m prouder than ever of
the family.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I decline to share this honour with
my grandfather,” I protested indignantly.
“He couldn’t keep his temper, bother
him!”</p>

<p class='c006'>We were at the door now, and Kate
gave me the prettiest of parting nods and
smiles.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Wasn’t it a pity?” she sighed. That
was distinctly nice of her. Just like a
Cortelyou woman.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Whew! Jack,” whistled Ferdie Gallaudet.
“I thought I should die, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>expected to sit on your body at the postmortem.”
Ferdie thinks he’s clever!</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, shut up, Ferdie,” I growled, dropping
back into my seat.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Don’t wonder your temper’s queered,”
persisted the little ass. “‘Wotinell’ did
you talk about?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Family matters,” I muttered.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, I say, that’s a bit shiny at the
joints. It was too well done to have
verged on that subject.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“We talked family matters, and enjoyed
it,” I insisted.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ever hear of George Washington?”
inquired Ferdie.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Kate mentioned him to me to-night,
and I promised to put him up at the
Knickerbocker for a month.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Kate!” exclaimed Ferdie.</p>

<p class='c006'>I lighted my cigar.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Kate!” he repeated, with a rising inflection.
“Now look here, I wasn’t born
yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Where’s your family Bible?” I inquired
blandly.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>“You’ll be saying next that to-night’s
arrangement was by ‘special request.’”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You were across the table,” I retorted.
“Draw your own conclusions.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I suppose you’ll join her later,” suggested
Ferdie, in an irritating manner.</p>

<p class='c006'>I wouldn’t be bluffed by him, so I replied
pointedly, “I may, to save her from
worse.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Give you odds on it,” offered Ferdie.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t make bets where women are
concerned,” I crushingly responded.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sorry the strain has left you so bad-tempered,”
said Ferdie, rising. “There’s
Caldwell beckoning to me. Ta, ta!”</p>

<p class='c006'>I have liked Caldwell ever since.</p>

<p class='c006'>When we joined the ladies I went over
to Kate.</p>

<p class='c006'>“This is persecution,” she smilingly protested,
as she made room for me on the sofa.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I know it,” I cheerfully groaned, as I
sat down beside her. “But I had to for
the sake of the family.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“A family is a terrible thing to live up
to!” sighed Kate.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>“Terrible!” I ejaculated.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Fortunately it will only be for a moment,”
she assured me.</p>

<p class='c006'>“If you go at once,” I urged, “they’ll
all think it’s the feud.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What a nuisance!” cried Kate. “I
ought to be on my way to a musical this
very minute.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“On the principle that music hath
charms?” I queried.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good-night!” she said, holding out
her hand. I had already noticed what
pretty hands Kate had.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Forgive me!” I begged.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Never!” she replied.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You are serious?” I questioned, and
she understood what I meant as if I had
said it. I do like people who can read
between the lines!</p>

<p class='c006'>She amended her “never” to, “Well,
not till I have had my chance to even the
score.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Take it now.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I haven’t time.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I will submit to anything.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>“My revenge must be deep.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I will do the thing I most hate.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Even afternoon teas?” laughed Kate,
archly.</p>

<p class='c006'>I faltered in voice while promising,
“Even afternoon teas!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then I’ll send you a card for mine,”
she ended, and left me, crushed and
hopeless.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>⁂</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>No. That didn’t end the feud. It
only led to a truce. For a time things
went very well, but then the quarrel broke
out with renewed force. You see, Kate
claimed I spoiled the boy, and I claimed
she did the spoiling. So we submitted it
to arbitration. My mother said Kate was
very judicious, and her father declared I
was a model parent. Then we called in
his godmother, and she decided we all
four spoiled him. It’s been open war
ever since, with an occasional brief cessation
of hostilities whenever Kate kisses
me. After the boy’s grown up, I suppose,
peace will come again.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>His godmother? Oh! Mrs. Baxter.
You see, we couldn’t do less, for she had
talked it all over town that the match was
of her making. Her making! In ten
cases out of nine she would have had a
disrupted dinner. It’s lucky for her that
Kate was a Cortelyou woman!</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Helen (louder).</i> More tea, mama!</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Rose (outside l., calling).</i> Are you having
tea, Helen?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Helen.</i> Yes, Rose.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Amy.</i> And something very exciting as
well.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>George.</i> More exciting even than your
novel, I’ll be bound.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span><i>Dennis (calling).</i> Bring the chocolates

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><i>Rose.</i> What is it?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Dennis.</i> Ask Mrs. Wycherly.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Rose.</i> What is the excitement, Mrs.
Wycherly?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>George.</i> Louder.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Amy (loudly).</i> Mrs. Wycherly!</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Mrs. W. (starting).</i> Oh! What?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>George.</i> That is just the problem. Is
he a what, or isn’t he?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Dennis (bitterly).</i> I don’t believe it will
make the least difference even if he proves
a “What is it.”</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Steven (more bitterly).</i> No, we fellows
see how it will be! The moment “me lud”
arrives, we shall be nowhere with you girls.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>George.</i> George Augustus Guelph Dunstan,
Earl of Ferrol and Staunton! His
very letter of acceptance has made Helen
forget that it is cream—not sugar—that
I “omit for want of space.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span><i>Helen.</i> Not at all! If you had been
polite you would have given that cup to
Rose. As for his lordling, do you for an
instant suppose that I intend to compete
as long as Rose and Amy are here? No,
sir—I leave him to my betters, <i>D. V.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Mrs. W.</i> Well, really, I don’t think
that either his titles or his being in the
hands of an oculist is any excuse for
making his time so indefinite (<i>looks at
letter</i>). He will be charmed to pay me a
visit, “by next Friday, or perhaps even
sooner.” Now isn’t that a nice position to
leave a hostess who wishes to make his
stay quite as pleasant as his papa made
mine when I was at the “Towers.” Imagine
this betitled being getting into the Junction
by the evening train and then having to
walk over to Beechcroft.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Rose.</i> Oh, wouldn’t it be lovely to see
him coming in at the gate, so wet and
muddy that Tiger would make the same
mistake that he did with that poor minister?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Dennis.</i> I hope, if he does have to foot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>it, he will not bring the usual number of
parcels that the swells on the other side
consider as necessary as those books which
Charlie Lamb said “no gentleman should
be without.”</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Amy.</i> Mrs. Wycherly, how can this
man be two earls at once?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Steven.</i> The English aristocracy finds
it convenient to have an alias now and
again.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Mrs. W.</i> I’m not sure, Amy, but I believe
it has something to do with his
mother. I never could understand the
peerage.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>George.</i> Ye gods! to think of a mother
with a marriageable daughter not understanding
the peerage!</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Helen.</i> I won’t be slandered by you.
Marriageable daughter, indeed!</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Rose (scornfully).</i> Yes, isn’t that a regular
man’s view of it?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Dennis.</i> Well, I think it’s very creditable
to be without a peer.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Amy.</i> That depends on how you appear.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span><i>Rose.</i> And that depends on your <i>appear
age</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>George (pityingly).</i> Don’t notice them;
they’re quite harmless. Speaking of the
peerage, though, did any of you see Labouchere’s
screed in “Truth”?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Mrs. W.</i> I haven’t, for one—what
was it?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>George.</i> Bass, the proprietor of the
pale ale, has just been made a baron, and
this was an editorial on the “Last Addition
to the Beerage.”</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Amy.</i> Mrs. Wycherly, do let me have
the letter: I want to see what kind of a
hand he writes.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>[<span class='sc'>Mrs. W.</span> <i>passes letter to</i> <span class='sc'>Amy</span>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><i>Dennis.</i> There! That’s the way in this
life. I’ll be bound you never wanted to
see what my writing was like.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Rose.</i> Well, did you ever want to see
Amy’s hand?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Steven.</i> Hers is too small to make it
worth while.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Amy (sweetly).</i> <i>Is</i> your tea sweet
enough, Steven?</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span><i>Dennis.</i> Why waste your sweetness on
the desert air?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Steven.</i> Thank you, Dennis, but I am
not a deserted heir, and don’t suppose I
shall be, till The Right Honourable
George Augustus Guelph Dunstan, Earl
of Ferrol and Staunton, puts in his appearance.
Till then, Mrs. Amy Sherman
Micawber will never desert her Steven.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Helen.</i> Really, I think it is very unkind
to say all these things before Lord
Ferrol arrives. If you begin like this over
the “cheerful and uninebriating teacup,”
with a good dinner not far distant, what
will you say when you have just dragged
yourself out of bed to breakfast?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Dennis (fiercely).</i> The talking point
will be passed. We shall act! Bul-lud!!!</p>

<p class='c006'><i>George (rising and setting teacup on tea-table).</i>
So let it be understood, if you
girls give us the cold shoulder when his
lordship arrives, we will not be responsible
for the consequences.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Steven.</i> But don’t say we didn’t warn
you.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span><i>Helen.</i> Well, you deserve to have the
cold shoulder for talking to us so.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Rose.</i> Yes, just as if we had all turned
tuft-hunters.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Mrs. W.</i> At least it shows modesty.
The boys all take for granted they cannot
stand up against the new-comer.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Rose.</i> Oh, Mrs. Wycherly, what nice,
honest, guileless men you must have
known when you were a girl! To think
that <i>these</i> should gain the reputation of
modesty by their grumbling!</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Helen.</i> Yes, dear, they are delusions
and snares, having fully mastered Talleyrand’s
aphorism “that words were meant
to conceal ideas.”</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Amy.</i> “Put not your trust in kings
and princes.”</p>

<p class='c006'><i>George.</i> That’s just what we want, only
please extend it to the aristocracy.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Rose.</i> You all deserve to have us leave
you to your own devices, as soon as we
can get a decent substitute.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Mrs. W.</i> Well, if Lord Ferrol is anything
like his father, I can promise you no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>unworthy one, even compared to <i>my</i> boys
here.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Steven (crossing down stage to Mrs.
W. and bowing).</i> Mrs. Wycherly, the
race does not improve. Why are the
daughters no longer as their mothers
were?</p>

men’s faces when the carriage came back

<p class='c006'><i>Amy.</i> Gracious! If we only could get
the real Ferrol here, in place of the fictitious,
and yet make the men think it was
Mr. Parker.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Rose.</i> But Lord Ferrol won’t be here
till Friday, and by that time the boys will
have either found it out, or suspect from
the time that it really is the genuine article.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Amy.</i> I’ll tell you what to do. Let
me wire my cousin Jack Williams to get
himself up as an Englishman, and come
up here on Tuesday. I can coach him so
that he can pass himself off for Mr. Parker,
and the two are enough alike, judging from
the description, if disguised, to fool the
boys.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Helen.</i> I hope it will take the boys so

that we can have your cousin alone for a
few minutes.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Rose.</i> No such luck as that! Our
evening’s skating will hardly weigh with
them, compared to the danger of our greeting
the supposed Mr. Parker without their
moral support to carry him through.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span><i>Helen.</i> I almost wish it were Mr.

<p class='c006'><i>Rose.</i> I don’t think I ever appreciated

<p class='c006'><i>Mrs. W.</i> Why, you blood-thirsty little

<p class='c006'><i>Helen.</i> Mama, we must make our arrangements
so that they will have no
chance to interview him this evening.
Then, to-morrow, we will either fully coach
him, or let them find out the trick—according
to our wishes.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Mrs. W.</i> Let me see,—I will meet
him at the front door; the moment the
carriage drives up—</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Helen.</i> Yes, and you must bring him
in here to tea. We won’t let him go till
the bell rings for dressing. Then we will
all see him upstairs.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Mrs. W.</i> But you can’t watch him
after he is once in his room, and any of
the men can go to him.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span><i>Rose.</i> “Not if the court understand
himself, and he thinks he do.” We will
spell each other, so that one of us shall
sit in the upper hall till Mr. Williams
comes downstairs. The boys would
never dare to run such a battery without
a better excuse than they can invent for
going to the room of an entire stranger.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Mrs. W.</i> That makes it safe till we
leave them to their cigars.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Helen (coming down, and sitting on the
arm of Mrs. W.’s chair).</i> Mama, you will
have to tell the boys that for a particular
reason, cause unspecified, you want to let
the servants clear the dining-room early,
so as to set them free. Tell them to
smoke in the library; we will sit with
them and put up with the smoke for
once.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Rose.</i> That will do, and you must
break up the party at our usual bed-time
with the excuse that Lord Ferrol, after
his journey, will want to retire early.
Take no denial, and we will escort him
upstairs. Then we girls will sit on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>divan in the hall and gossip till we feel
sure that all is safe.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Mrs. W.</i> I hope, Lord Ferrol, that
there has been enough pleasant in your

disagreeable.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Lord F.</i> Er, quite so. The trip has
been vastly enjoyable.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Rose.</i> Where have you been?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Lord F.</i> I landed in New York and
spent the night there, but it was such a
bore that I went on to Niagara the next
day. From there I travelled through the
Rockies, getting some jolly sport, and then
went to Florida.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Mrs. W.</i> Why, you have seen a large
part of our country; even more than your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>father did. I remember his amazement
at our autumn foliage. He said it was
the most surprising thing in the trip.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Amy.</i> What did you think of it, Lord
Ferrol?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Lord F.</i> It struck me as rather gaudy.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Rose.</i> Why, I had never thought of it,
but perhaps it is a little vivid.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Dennis (aside to men).</i> Oh, how I

<p class='c006'><i>Steven (aside to Dennis).</i> Hush! You

<p class='c006'><i>George.</i> Didn’t you ever see a Venetian

<p class='c006'><i>Lord F.</i> Oh, yes. Why do you ask?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>George (sarcastically).</i> I merely thought
it might be open to the same objection!</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Lord F.</i> It might—I don’t remember.
I’ll look it up in my journal when I get
home, and see if it impressed me at the
time.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Helen.</i> Do you keep a journal? (<i>Rises

How delightful! (<i>Beseechingly.</i>) Oh,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>won’t you let me look at what you have
with you?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Rose.</i> Please, Lord Ferrol!</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Amy.</i> Ah, do!</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Lord F.</i> It would bore you, I’m sure.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Dennis (aside).</i> I don’t care if he isn’t
a double-barrelled earl, I should like to
kick him all the same!</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Helen.</i> Lord Ferrol, you must let us
hear some of it.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Rose.</i> If you don’t we shall think you
have said something uncomplimentary of
the American women.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Lord F.</i> No, I assure you I have
been quite delighted.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Amy.</i> Then why won’t you let us
see it?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Lord F.</i> Er, I couldn’t, you know; but
if you really are in earnest, I’ll read you
some extracts.</p>

<p class='c006'><i><span lang="la">Omnes.</span></i> Oh, do!</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Lord F.</i> I ought to explain that I
started with the intention of writing a
book on America, so this (<i>producing book</i>)
is not merely what I did and saw, but
desultory notes on the States.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span><i>Rose.</i> How interesting!</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Lord F.</i> After your suggestion of what
I have written of the American women, I
think it best to give you some of my notes
on them.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Mrs. W.</i> By all means!</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Lord F. (reading).</i> “Reached Washington,
the American capital, and went
direct to Mrs. ——. Cabman charged
me sixteen shillings. When I made a row,
butler sent for my host, who, instead of
calling a constable, made me pay the fellow,
by insisting on paying it himself.
Mr. —— is a Senator, and is seen very
little about the house, from which I infer
the American men are not domestic—presumably,
because of their wild life—”</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Mrs. W. (with anxiety).</i> Their what?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Lord F.</i> Their wild life,—spending so
much of their time on the plains, don’t you
know.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Mrs. W. (relieved).</i> Oh! Excuse my
misapprehension.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Lord F. (reading).</i> “The daughter is
very pretty, which Mrs. —— tells me is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>unusual in Washington society—as if
I could be taken in by such an obvious
Dowager puff! (<i>Men all point at Mrs. W.
and laugh. Mrs. W. shakes her finger
reprovingly.</i>) Miss —— says the Boston
girls are plain and thin, due to their living
almost wholly on fads, which are very
unhealthy.” (<i>Speaking.</i>) I couldn’t find
that word in the dictionary.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Steven.</i> Sort of intellectual chewinggum,
Lord Ferrol.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Dennis.</i> Yes, and like gum, you never
get beyond a certain point with it. It’s
very fatiguing to the jaw.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Lord F. (reading).</i> “She says the New
York girls are the best dressed in the
country, being hired by the dressmakers
to wear gowns, to make the girls of other
cities envious, and that this is where they
get all the money they spend. Very
remarkable!”</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Helen.</i> Something like sandwich men,
evidently.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Lord F. (reading).</i> “The Philadelphia
girls, she says, are very fast, but never for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>long at a time, because the men get sleepy
and must have afternoon naps.”</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Amy.</i> Did she tell you that insomnia
is thought to make one very distinguished
there?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Lord F. (making note in book).</i> Er,
thanks, awfully. (<i>Reading.</i>) “She says
that the Baltimore girls are great beauties,
and marry so quickly that there is generally
a scarcity. It is proposed to start
a joint stock company to colonise that city
with the surplus from Boston, and she
thinks there ought to be lots of money in
it! Another extreme case of American
dollar worship! The Western girls, she
told me, are all blizzards.” (<i>Speaking.</i>) I
don’t think I could have mistaken the
word, for I made her spell it. Yet the
American dictionary defines blizzard as
a great wind or snow storm.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>George.</i> That is it, Lord Ferrol. They
talk so much that it gives the effect of a
wind storm.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Lord F.</i> Ah! much obliged. (<i>Reading.</i>)
“Went to eight receptions in one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>afternoon, where I was introduced to a
lot of people, and talked to nobody.
Dined out somewhere, but can’t remember
the name. Took in a Miss ——,
a most charming and lovely—”</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Dennis (interrupting).</i> Ah, there!</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Lord F.</i> I beg pardon.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Rose.</i> You must forgive his rude interruption,
Lord Ferrol.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Lord F.</i> Oh, certainly! You’re sure
you’re not bored?</p>

<p class='c006'><i><span lang="la">Omnes.</span></i> By no means. Do go on.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Lord F.</i> “A most charming and lovely
girl from New York. She thinks Miss ——
characterised the cities rightly, except
her own. Asked me if I thought
she was only a dressmaking advertisement?
As scarcely any of her dress was
to be seen, I replied that as I couldn’t
look below the table, I was sure it was the
last thing one would accuse her of being.
She blushed so violently that I had to tell
her that I had seen much worse dresses in
London; but that didn’t please her any
better, and she talked to the man next her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>for the rest of the evening. (<i>All have

Will make interesting reading, though.
Ah, a good chance to fill up my journal.
(<i>Seats himself at desk, takes out book, and
writes, speaking aloud and soliloquising as
he does so.</i>) “At 5.15 reached some unpronounceable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>and unspellable place. Was
met by Mrs. Wycherly at front door”—curious
fashion that! It made me take
her for the housekeeper at first. “She
insisted, in spite of my protests,”—I suppose
it was an American idea of hospitality,—“in
taking me at once into the
drawing-room and presenting me to the
house-party, and giving me a cup of tea.
I felt very disagreeable, both from the condition
I was in, and the fact that all of
them kept making remarks which were
entirely unintelligible to me. The young
ladies were very kind, but more forward
even than they are in England, though
in a different way.”—I confess I rather
liked it.—“Read some of my journal aloud
and had no corrections. Blizzard applied
to Western girls means that they talk a
great deal. Was shown to my room by
Mrs. Wycherly and the young ladies,
which was rather embarrassing, especially
as they seemed inclined to linger, and
only hurried out on the appearance of the
gentlemen. On leaving, one of the girls
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>slipped her hand into mine and gave it a
distinct squeeze, at the same time asking
in a whisper, ‘Did your sister send her
love?’”—Now the idea of Sappho sending
her love to a girl of whom she had
never heard!—“I pretended not to hear,
but she evidently knew that she had been
too free, for as she left she jerked her
head towards the gentlemen and said,
‘They didn’t see.’ Could not change my
travelling suit, my boxes having gone
astray. Found a letter pinned to my
pin-cushion, and when the valet brought
the hot water, he gave me another. Both,
judging from the hand-writing and paper,
seem to be written by ladies and gentlemen.”—I
should like to know what they
mean? I wonder if it’s good form in
America to play jokes on guests? (<i>Produces
notes and reads.</i>) “Dear F.”—(<i>Rises
and comes to c.</i>) Now the idea of the
fellow writing to me in that way on the
acquaintance of a single afternoon—why,
even my best friends only say “Dear
Ferrol.”—“You were simply marvellous.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>I would have staked my bottom dollar on
your identity, if I had not known who you
were.”—Now what does he mean by that,
I wonder?—“You were so real that
Dennis wanted to kick you, and nothing
but the presence of the ladies prevented
him.”—Gad! I wonder if these fellows
can be gentlemen, and if so, whether they
are a fair specimen—kick me! (<i>Pause.</i>)
Well, I suppose they’re jealous.—“So
don’t be too hard on us. Now as to the
future. If we do not see each other this
evening, you must get up before breakfast,
go out of the side door, and strike across
the lawn toward the river. Three minutes’
walk will bring you in sight of a little
summer-house. Come to it, and some of
us will be there prepared to instruct you
as to yourself, and put you on your guard
as to the girls, who, you see, are making a
dead set at you.”—You know, that’s just
what I thought.—“Remember, in the
bright lexicon, etc., etc., Steve.”—Now
what does he mean by “bright lexicon?”
And does he think I’m going to tramp
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>through the snow, when it’s so evidently
a joke? (<i>Opens other note.</i>) “You dear love
of a snob”—Now I should vastly like
to know how that is meant. I don’t
think it’s a nice way of beginning a letter,
I’m sure. Yet she evidently means it as
a compliment—“You were so perfectly
delicious that I could scarcely forbear from
giving you a kiss.”—Extraordinary!—“Indeed
I think I will to-morrow, just to
make the boys desperate. I only hope
your life is insured, for Dennis will probably
chuck you out of the window, when I
do, and it’s too cold for the window to be
opened. Fortunately there is plenty of
soft snow to break the fall.”—Now isn’t
that a nasty way of joking! One would
actually think she enjoyed the prospect of
seeing me thrown out the window.—“I
have given directions that you are to be
called early, and as soon as you can, I
want you to come to the valley summer-house.
Turn to your right, and walk
straight towards the river, and you can’t
miss it. There you will find a bevy of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>maidens waiting to metaphorically hug
and kiss you, and instruct you so that you
may play the part of George Augustus
Guelph Dunstan, Earl of Ferrol and
Staunton, with sufficient stupidity and
vanity. Amy”—Now I should like to
know what all that means. (<i>Reflectively.</i>)
Amy—she’s the one who told me I was
beautiful the first time she spoke to me. I
should like to know what she means!</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Polly (coming down wearily).</i> Mercy,
how tired I am! And no chance of rest
for at least six hours (<i>drops into chair c.</i>).
Dinners and balls may be fun for those who
do the eating and dancing, but it’s death
on us poor servants. I’m worked hard
enough usually, in all conscience’ sake, but
Miss Agnes has given me just the hardest
day I’ve ever seen! (<i>Imitates Agnes giving
orders.</i>) “Polly, is my bath ready?”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>“Polly, give me my dressing-gown.”
“Polly, bring me my coffee.” “Now dress
my hair, Polly.” “Get me my habit,
Polly.” (<i>Rises.</i>) “While I’m in the park,
Polly, sew the ribbons on my two dominos.”
“Oh, and I’ll be too busy to-day
to write acknowledgments for the bouquets,
Polly, so you may write to Mr. Stevens and
Mr. Van Tromp and Mr. Newbank, and
any others that come, thanking them
for their lovely flowers, which are now
filling my room with sweetness!” From
seven till eight it’s been nothing but “Polly,
do this,” and “Polly, do that,” and “Where’s
Polly?” And no one so much as said
“Polly, want a cracker?” I haven’t had a
chance to sit down since I got up. I even
had to eat my dinner off the laundry tubs
(<i>mimics eating with pen and paper-cutter
at desk</i>) standing, because the caterers
were everywhere, getting the dinner and
ball supper ready. Miss Agnes says she’s
all “worn out.” I wish she could try
my work once in a while. How I should
enjoy telling the rich and sought-after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>Miss Agnes Wortley to (<i>mimicking</i>) “button
my shoes,” (<i>sticks out foot</i>) or (<i>waves her
hand</i>) “fetch me my gloves!” I would give
a month’s wages if I could only take her
place just for to-night at the masked ball.
(<i>Speaking with excitement.</i>) When she
decided that she must have two dominos,
so that she could change in the middle of
the ball, I thought to myself: ‘What’s
to prevent your slipping on the domino
she isn’t wearing, and going downstairs?’
(<i>Muses.</i>) If I only dared! I could easily
slip out before she wanted to change!
(<i>Pause.</i>) No! I mustn’t even think of it
or the temptation will be too great.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Fred (sits chair l. as if discouraged).</i>
No use! As they say out West, it’s come

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart.</i> Oh, I didn’t mean your love for
Miss Wortley. She’s a sweet, unspoiled
girl, in spite of her own and her papa’s
money, and I hope you’ll win her. I was
only trying to cheer you out of your dumps,
and make you look at the golden side of
things.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Fred.</i> That’s just what I see all the
time, and what comes between us. I can’t
forget her money.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart (springing to his feet).</i> There!
That goes to prove a pet little theory of
mine, that it is rather hard for a rich girl to
marry well.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Fred.</i> I should think you needed a confirmatory
evidence.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span><i>Stuart.</i> You are just like the rest!
You take the conventionally superficial
view of it.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Fred.</i> Very well, turn lawyer and argue
your case before referee Mr. Frederick
Stevens, junior member of the celebrated
firm of Mary, Green and Hart.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart.</i> You fire my ambition. Well,
(<i>rising and imitating legal style</i>) your
honour, and gentlemen of the jury, <i><span lang="la">a priori</span></i>
and <i>imprimis</i> we start with the postulate
that the party of the first part, otherwise the
girl with money, is usually so spoiled that
most fellows won’t care for her. But we
will leave that out of the argument and
say that she is a nice girl. Well, by her
parents, her friends, and her reading, she
is taught to think that every man who is
attentive to her may be a fortune-hunter.
The consequence is that she is suspicious,
and may say or do something to wound or
insult a fellow who cares for her, and so
drive him off.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Fred.</i> That’s one point for your side.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart.</i> But even if she is not made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>suspicious by her money, (<i>points at Fred</i>)
he is. A decent man dreads to have his
motives misjudged. He’s afraid that the
girl, or her father, or her mother, or her
friends, or his friends, will think he is
fortune-hunting.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Fred.</i> I should think he did!</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart.</i> Finally, her money draws about
her a lot of worthless fellows. As a consequence,
she is always beset and engaged.
You must remember that in this country
a man, if he amounts to a row of pins, is a
worker, and not a drone. He cannot,
therefore, dance the continual attendance
that is necessary to see much of a society
girl nowadays. This can only be done
by our rich and leisured young men, who
are few and far between; by foreign titles,
who are quite as scarce; and by the idlers
and do-nothings, who, if the girl is worth
winning, are as distasteful to her as they
are to the rest of mortal kind. (<i>Sits chair
c.</i>) I submit my case.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Fred.</i> Mr. Stuart, you entirely missed
your vocation. Allow me to congratulate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>you on your <i>maiden</i> argument. But at
the same time the referee would call your
attention to the fact that you have failed
to take the relatives into account. They
can overcome all this by heading off
the undesirables and encouraging their
choice.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart.</i> But that’s just what they
won’t do, and which I don’t think they
could to any extent, even if they tried.
How much can Mr. Wortley and Mrs.
Van Tromp control Miss Agnes’ companions
at the dinners and dances and other
affairs, which are practically the only places
where she meets men?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Fred.</i> Here they can.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart.</i> But they don’t. You say Mr.
Wortley favours Newbank and Mrs. Van
Tromp encourages her brother-in-law.
Naturally, then, they don’t approve your
very evident liking for Miss Agnes. Yet
I see you here quite as often as either of
the favoured ones. Do you think if this
system of exclusion were possible, it would
not have been practised long ago?</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span><i>Fred.</i> If you ask it as a conundrum I
give it up. But I know that neither of
them want me to marry Miss Wortley.
Mr. Wortley wishes Newbank’s millions
to add to the family. Mrs. Van Tromp
hopes to graft Miss Wortley on the fine
old stock of Van Tromps.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart.</i> And what does the person
most concerned want? In this glorious
country of ours, where children always
know more than parents, the girl’s consent
is really the only requisite. What does
Miss Wortley want?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Fred.</i> I only wish I knew!</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart.</i> Well, how does she treat you
compared with the other men?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Fred.</i> At first she was very nice and
friendly, but latterly she’ll have nothing
to do with me.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart.</i> A girl of taste!</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Fred.</i> I’m in the mood to enjoy such
friendly jokes.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart.</i> It was meant kindly, Fred, as
you will see in a moment. Now, my boy,
I’m going to give you a talking to, and if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>you resent it, it will only be further confirmation
of another little theory of mine,
that a man’s an ass who concerns himself
in other people’s affairs.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Fred.</i> Go ahead. I’m blue enough to
like anything sour or disagreeable.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart.</i> Now, there at once you give
me the text to preach from. (<i>Walks behind
chair l. and leans on back, speaking
over it down r.</i>) About a year ago a
certain gentleman named Fred meets a
certain lady named Agnes. We’ll say he
met her at a dance—</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Fred.</i> No, it was yachting.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart.</i> Ah!—excuse my lack of historical
accuracy. Well, on a yacht—he
met her; then at a ball—he met her;
then at a cotillion—he met her; then at
a dinner—he met her. In short, he met
her, and met her, and met her.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Fred (gloomily).</i> Yes, and what is more,
he spent hours trying to.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart.</i> Well, she was pretty and charming
and—I’m short of an adjective, Fred.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span><i>Fred.</i> Of course you are! There isn’t
one in Webster’s Unabridged which would
do her justice!</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart.</i> That should have been said to
her and not wasted on me. Well, we’ll
say the girl is plu-perfect. The fellow
is rather good looking—eh, Fred?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Fred.</i> I don’t know.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart.</i> He talks and dances well;
and is, in fact, quite a shining light among
her devotees.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Fred (irritably).</i> Oh, cut it, for heaven’s
sake!</p>
<div class='c018'>[<i>Rises impatiently.</i></div>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart (laughing).</i> Excuse me,—the
story-teller never cuts; it’s the editor
who does that.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Fred (angrily).</i> Oh, go on.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart.</i> Well, at first this masculine
paragon whom I have so meagrely described
seems to be doing well. She
likes his society and shows it. (<i>To Fred.</i>)
Right?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Fred.</i> I thought so.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart.</i> But as he gets more interested,
he changes. He makes his attentions and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>feelings too marked—something no girl
likes. Then he is cross and moody when
she does not give him most of her time and
dances. He is inclined to be jealous of
every Tom, Dick, and Harry who comes
near her, and absurdly tries to dictate
what she shall do and not do; which she
resents. In short, the very strength of
his love makes him an entirely different
kind of a man. He is neither companionable
nor entertaining; he is both surly
and passionate. Do you blame her for
repulsing him?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Fred.</i> No, you are right. I know
I’ve given her reason for turning me the
cold shoulder.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart.</i> Then if you’ve known this,
why haven’t you behaved yourself?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Fred.</i> I’ve tried to, over and over
again; but when I see such cads as Van
Tromp and Newbank and the rest of the
pack around her, I get perfectly desperate.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart.</i> And why? Now, Van Tromp
is not only a fool, which I suppose is the
fault of his ancestors, but he is so impecunious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>that every girl who has money must
suspect his motives. Newbank is wealthy,
but is the kind of man who makes one think
of Wendell Phillips’ remark, that “the
Lord showed his estimate of money by the
people he gave it to.” Why should you
be jealous of such rivals? You stand at
least as good a chance as they.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Fred.</i> No I don’t. Look here, I’ve
just been made a member of the firm.
That will give me something like $4,000
a year at first. How can I ask a girl living
as she does to try and get along on that?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart.</i> You forget her own income.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Fred.</i> That’s just what I can’t do. I’ve
tried to tell her that I love her, but her
money makes the words stick in my throat.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart.</i> And yet Van Tromp, who
hasn’t a cent in the world, and never will
have, if he has to make it himself, will say
it as glibly as need be.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Fred.</i> It’s that makes me desperate.
I try to be good company, but I feel all
the time as if it weren’t an even race, and
so I can’t.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span><i>Stuart.</i> My dear boy, no race in this
world is even. If it were anything but a
woman’s heart in question, I would bet on
you as the winner; but as that commodity
is only to be represented by the algebraic
<i>x</i>, I never wager on it.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Fred (scornfully).</i> How learnedly a
bachelor does talk of women’s hearts!
One would think he had broken a lot
in order to examine their contents.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart (a little angrily).</i> I never lost
a girl through faint heart,—or lost my

you are right and I am a fool.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart.</i> No, of course not. Quite

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span><i>Stuart (throwing match in fire).</i> That

<div class='c018'>[<i>Bows.</i></div>

<p class='c006'><i>Mrs. V. T.</i> I am too good a queen to help
stamp worthless money, and that’s what a
compliment is. As the French say, “Fine
words cost nothing and are worth just
what they cost.”</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart.</i> Anglisé in “Fine words butter
no parsnips.” You know, I’ve always
wanted to send that proverb to Delmonico.
He takes something uneatable, and by
giving it a sauce and a high-sounding
French title, deludes the public into ordering
it. You pay five cents for the basis,
ten for the sauce, and the other thirty-five
for the French, which no man can understand
or pronounce.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Mrs. V. T.</i> He didn’t serve this evening’s

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart.</i> Far be it from me to suggest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>that there was anything wrong in the

could possibly make on the dinner was that
there were twenty-four too many people.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Mrs. V. T. (counting on fingers).</i>
Twenty-four from twenty-six—that leaves
two?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart.</i> Let me congratulate you on
your mental arithmetic.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Mrs. V. T.</i> Have you actually reached
that time of life when one ceases to enjoy
dinners?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart.</i> I hope not. I was even flattering
myself that my tastes were becoming
more juvenile.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Mrs. V. T.</i> In what does that show
itself?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart.</i> In wanting something I can’t
have. I believe it’s considered infantile
to want the moon.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Mrs. V. T.</i> You want the moon?
Then you must be in love! I’m so sorry

I’ll not bore you with my own love affair,
but I should like to ask your help in
another.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Mrs. V. T. (turning and coming down
l.).</i> I promise my assistance. I love to
help on—other people’s love affairs.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart.</i> There is a poor fellow downstairs
who is eating his heart out with love
for your cousin Agnes. He thinks you
are against him.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Mrs. V. T.</i> You mean Mr. Stevens?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart.</i> Yes.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Mrs. V. T.</i> Why, Mr. Stuart, I like
Mr. Stevens, and he would be my second
choice—</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart (interrupting).</i> For yourself?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Mrs. V. T. (laughing).</i> No, for Agnes.
But surely you don’t expect me to work
against my brother-in-law?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart.</i> But Agnes is your cousin.
Do consider her!</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Mrs. V. T.</i> Mr. Stuart, I married
Alexander Van Tromp without caring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>that (<i>snaps her fingers</i>) for him. Yet we
hit it off together very nicely. He obtained
income and I won social position.
By it I have been able to introduce my
uncle into good society, and give Agnes
her pick of the best. Do you think I do
her wrong in planning the same kind of a
marriage for her?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart.</i> Has Cupid no rights?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Mrs. V. T.</i> He can come later. The
Van Tromps are too old a family for the
members to live long. So I am only giving
Agnes a few years of matrimony, like
my own; and then—well, you know
whether my life is gloomy or otherwise.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart.</i> Mostly otherwise, I should say.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Mrs. V. T.</i> No girl of nineteen knows
enough to pick out the man she can breakfast
with three hundred and sixty-five days
in the year for half a century. Moreover,
a young girl cannot have a large enough
choice. She can only say “yes” or “no”
to those who ask her. On the contrary, a
woman of—we’ll say twenty-eight—picks
out her man and fascinates him. To
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>quote the French again: “A girl of sixteen
accepts love; a woman of thirty incites
it.”</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart.</i> As you have been doing?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Mrs. V. T.</i> Agnes shall sample matrimony
with Regie; see just what it is like;
and then be prepared to select a second
time with wisdom and discrimination—like
her aged and venerable cousin.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart (hesitatingly).</i> Will you pardon
the question,—but was Mr.—was, ah, the
brother of Reginald anything like, ah, his
brother?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Mrs. V. T. (laughing).</i> Very!</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart (confidentially).</i> What did you
do with him?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Mrs. V. T.</i> On the day we married,
he put a ring on my finger; I put one
through his nose. Then he led very
nicely.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart.</i> And is that your ideal of a
husband?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Mrs. V. T.</i> Unless I find a man capable
of not merely doing the leading, but
by whom I shall wish to be led.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span><i>Stuart.</i> And how is this man to prove
his capacity?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Mrs. V. T.</i> Oh, it’s merely a matter
of cleverness or mastery. Let a man outwit
me, and I will (<i>curtseys</i>) ever after
sign myself, “Your obedient, humble
servant.”</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart.</i> Don’t you see that you are
bribing your own undoing?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Mrs. V. T.</i> How so?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart.</i> Why, your conditions are almost
in the nature of a challenge. Now
you know, of course, Mrs. Van Tromp,
that I don’t love you, yet you make me
want to enter the rather formidable competition
just to see if I couldn’t get the
better of you.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Mrs. V. T. (laughing).</i> Well, I have no
wish to balk you. But it must be a game
of forfeits. If you fail, you must pay a
penalty.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart.</i> Isn’t failure to win Mrs. Van
Tromp penalty enough?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Mrs. V. T.</i> Not to so confirmed a
bachelor as Mr. Stuart. Come, if you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>beat me, I will do any one thing you wish;

<p class='c006'><i>Fred (gloomily).</i> I haven’t had the

I’ve looked everywhere else for her. Not
that it’s much loss. I know I should not
have been in the mood to please her.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart.</i> That’s because you don’t try
hard enough.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Fred (bitterly).</i> Hear the bachelor
talk of making love!</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart.</i> You think me ignorant?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Fred.</i> Rather,—judging from the results.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart (resting hand on Fred’s shoulder).</i>
Fred, I’m not the kind of a man who
lets the world know what he’s thinking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>about. With all due respect to a young
fellow who is not far distant, it doesn’t
pay to show one’s feelings too much. But
I’m going to tell you my bit of romance
as an object-lesson. Two months ago I met
the most charming woman in the world,
and could no more help falling in love—</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Fred (looking up in surprise).</i> What!
The ideal bachelor in love?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart.</i> I don’t see why two and
forty should be debarred from that universal
sensation, any more than four
and twenty.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Fred.</i> Oh, of course not,—only, to
make an Irish bull, we had all grown to
think you as wedded to celibacy.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart.</i> There are divorces and desertions
in celibacy as well as in matrimony.
Well, I love this woman; I don’t think
she loves me,—though you never can tell
with a clever one, and sometimes I think
she is beginning to like me, because she—because
she tries to make me believe
she is worse than she is. She delights in
making me think she’s a devil, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>shows that she is a bit afraid of me. I’ve
never said a word of my love to her, but
she knows it as well as I do. But nobody
else dreams of it. I don’t make my attentions
so obvious that every one sees them,
and so cause her embarrassment whenever
I even come into the room. I don’t
cut up rough if she talks or dances with
other fellows. I simply try to be pleasant
and useful enough to make her prefer my
society to that of any other man.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Fred (sighing).</i> Well, of course you
are right, but—tell me what you think I
ought to do.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart (walking to desk and holding bell).</i>

<p class='c006'><i>Fred.</i> Do you think that’s honourable?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart.</i> It’s too soon after dinner for
me to discuss ethics. But for you it’s
the chance of a lifetime. You know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>what Miss Wortley is to wear. Go and
make yourself agreeable to her, and if her
mask gives you courage, tell her that you
love her.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Fred.</i> You don’t understand. I’m not
afraid to tell her that to her face. It’s
not the woman I’m afraid of. If she
were poor, I could have said to her as I
say to myself, fifty times a day, “I love
you.” But I can’t say that to her money.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart.</i> And so you are going to place
your Brunhilde on the top of her gold and
then fear to climb the fiery mountain?
Why, Fred, tell her that you love her, and
leave it for her to decide whether it’s the
woman or the wealth you care for.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Fred.</i> I can’t bear to give her the
chance even to think I’m sordid.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart.</i> Nonsense, my boy! Go and
tell Miss Wortley that you love her before
it’s too late. Make her the prettiest compliment
a man can pay a woman, and if
she has the bad taste to think it’s her
money and not her beauty and sweetness,
you are no worse off.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span><i>Fred.</i> Mr. Stuart, I’ve tried to say it

<p class='c006'><i>Fred.</i> Mr. Stuart, your proposition

you do speak?</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span><i>Stuart (gallantly and bowing).</i> In your
society only the universal language.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Agnes.</i> And I don’t understand Volapük.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart.</i> Volapük! That’s not the one
of which I speak.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Agnes.</i> And of what, then?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart.</i> To the language which without
instruction is known around the world;
to the language that’s spoken by all classes,
and is never out of fashion; to the language
that has no dictionary; yet which possesses
the most beautiful vocabulary in the universe.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Agnes.</i> I don’t remember any such in
my text-book on philology.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart.</i> It is too real to be taught in
schools. Nor were you old enough to
understand it had it been. I speak of the
language of love.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Agnes.</i> Of course; I suppose it is a
universal tongue. (<i>Satirically.</i>) But so
few can speak it well. Don’t you think it
ought to be left to the poets?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart.</i> I love the future of the human
race too much to wish that. Think of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>frightful increase of bad rhymers it would
cause,—and that too with the markets
already overstocked.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Agnes.</i> But would that be any worse
than to see the average unromantic breadwinner
make love? It’s very hard on our
sex to appear sympathetic. Most men do
it about as successfully as a hippopotamus
would waltz.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart.</i> Aren’t you a little unfair, Mrs.
Van Tromp?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Agnes.</i> And so you think I am Mrs.
Van Tromp?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart.</i> I don’t think it; I know it. Do
you think for a moment you could deceive
me? But that doesn’t answer my question.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Agnes.</i> As to the justice of my criticism
on the way men propose? (<i>With affected
coyness.</i>) Perhaps I have had too
little experience to speak with knowledge.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart.</i> Mrs. Van Tromp would not
dare to say that unmasked. Her face
would give her tongue the lie.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Agnes.</i> I fancy you are the first man
who ever turned calling one a liar into a
compliment.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span><i>Stuart.</i> Since that is possible, may not
a poetic proposal be also?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Agnes.</i> Perhaps. And when I hear
one that does not make me want to laugh,
I’ll make public recantation.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart.</i> It’s a bold man or a fool who’d
venture after what you have said. And yet
I should like to try.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Agnes (laughing).</i> Why, Mr. Stuart,
what would you do if I were to take you
seriously and say yes?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart (with mock resignation).</i> Bear
it—like a man. But I am quite safe from
that danger! I trust you won’t mind if in
the passion of the moment I call you
Frances.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Agnes.</i> This once I’ll condone the
liberty.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Stuart (coming very close to Agnes).</i>
And if I should so far forget myself as to
try and—well, behave as lovers generally
do?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Agnes (retreating).</i> Oh, Mrs. Van
Tromp is quite safe from that.</p>

to my desk and bachelor quarters, but
neither they nor I have been the same
since. It’s always seemed to me as if a
bit of heaven had come into my life in

consecrated to an ideal. I have worked
as I was never able to work before. And
why? Because I was straining every fibre

able to come to you and say: “Miss
Wortley, I love you as a man must love
one so sweet and beautiful. I’m not rich,

make a few sacrifices I will try and keep
you from regretting them, by love and

conclusions.</p>
